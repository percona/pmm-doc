# Backup and Restore

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
    Backup and restore features are a technical preview and currently only works with a MySQL database server or a MongoDB replica set cluster, backing up to an Amazon AWS S3 storage location.

!!! summary alert alert-info "Summary"
    - Enable backup features.
    - Add a storage location.
    - Satisfy preconditions:
        - For [MySQL](#mysql-backup-preconditions):
            - Confirm instance service parameters and storage location.
            - Install required packages.
        - For [MongoDB](#mongodb-backup-preconditions):
            - Install and run [Percona Backup for MongoDB] on every node in the replica set.
    - [Make a backup](#make-a-backup), or,
    - [Restore a backup](#restore-a-backup).

4. Click *Add* to add the location or *Test* to test the connection.

## MySQL backup preconditions

- There is only one MySQL instance running on the node.

- MySQL is running:

    - as a service via `systemd`;

    - with the name `mysql` (to confirm, use `systemctl status mysql`);

    - from a `mysql` system user account.

- There is a `mysql` system group.

- MySQL is using the `/var/lib/mysql` directory for database storage.

- The following packages are installed. They should be included in the `$PATH` environment variable:

    - [`xtrabackup`][PERCONA_XTRABACKUP], which includes:

        - [`xbcloud`][PERCONA_XBCLOUD];

        - [`xbstream`][PERCONA_XBSTREAM];

    - [`qpress`][PERCONA_QPRESS].

    **The versions of each must be compatible with the installed version of MySQL.**

## MongoDB backup preconditions

- [Percona Backup for MongoDB] is installed and `pbm-agent` is running on all MongoDB nodes in the replica set.

- MongoDB is a member of a replica set.

## Make a backup

1. Select <i class="uil uil-history"></i> → *Backup* → *Backup Inventory*.

2. Click <i class="uil uil-plus-square"></i> *Add*.

3. In the *Backup On Demand* dialog, enter values for:

    - *Service name*: Choose from the menu the service to back up.
    - *Vendor*: A value is automatically selected based on the service type.
    - *Backup name*: Enter a unique name for this backup.
    - *Description*: Enter a long description for this backup.
    - *Location*: Choose from the menu the [storage location](#add-a-storage-location).

4. Click *Backup*.

5. In the *Backup Inventory* pane, watch the *Status* column.

## Restore a backup

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    For now, you can only restore a backup to the same service it was created from. I.e. a MySQL backup of service `mysql-service-1` can only be restored to a MySQL database server registered with the same service name. Future releases will give more flexibility to restore backups to other service types.

1. Select <i class="uil uil-history"></i> → *Backup* → *Backup Inventory*.

2. Find the row with the backup you want to restore.

3. In the *Actions* column for that row, click *Restore from backup*.

4. In the *Restore from backup* dialog, check the values and click *Restore*.

5. Navigate to the *Restore History* tab to check the status of the restored backup.
