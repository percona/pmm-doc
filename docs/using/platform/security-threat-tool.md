# Security Threat Tool

The Security Threat Tool runs regular checks against connected databases, alerting you if any servers pose a potential security threat.

All checks run on the PMM Client side. Results are sent to PMM Server where a summary count is shown on the *Home Dashboard*, with details in the *PMM Database Checks* dashboard.

Checks are automatically downloaded from Percona Platform and run every 24 hours. (This period is not configurable.)

**Check results data *always* remains on the PMM Server.** It is not related to anonymous data sent for Telemetry purposes.

The *Failed security checks* panel on the *Home Dashboard* shows the number of failed checks classed as *critical* (red), *major* (amber), and *trivial* (blue).

Details are in the *PMM Database Checks* dashboard (select *PMM → PMM Database Checks*).

## How to enable

The Security Threat Tool (STT) is disabled by default. To enable it, select <i class="uil uil-cog"></i> *Configuration* → <i class="uil uil-setting"></i> *Settings* → *Advanced Settings*. [(Read more.)](../../how-to/configure.md#advanced-settings).

Enabling STT in the settings also causes the PMM server to download STT checks from Percona Platform and run them once. This operation runs in the background so even though the settings update finishes instantly it might take some time for the checks to complete download and execution and the results (if any) to be visible in the *PMM Database Checks* dashboard.

## Change a check's interval

1. Click *{{icon.checks}} Security Checks*.

2. Select the *All Checks* tab.

3. In the *Actions* column for a chosen check, click the <i class="uil uil-history"></i> *Interval* icon.

4. Chose an interval: *Standard*, *Rare*, *Frequent*.

5. Click *Save*.
