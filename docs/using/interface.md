    The defaults are:

    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `admin`

4. Click *Log in*

5. If this is your first time logging in, you'll be asked to set a new password. (We recommend you do.) Enter a new password in both fields and click *Submit*. You can click *Skip* to carry on with the default password.

6. The PMM Home dashboard loads. (This is an example taken from <https://pmmdemo.percona.com/>. Yours may be different.)

## Dashboards

The interface is a collection of web pages called *dashboards*.

Dashboards are grouped into *folders*. You can customize these, by renaming them or creating new ones.

The area inside dashboards is populated by *panels*. Some are in collapsible panel groups. A panel can show a value, a graph, a chart, or a visual representation of a set.

## Controls

These menus and controls appear on all dashboards:

1. Main menu  (also *Grafana menu*, *side menu*)
2. Navigation bar
3. View controls
4. View selectors (dynamic contents)
5. Shortcut menu (dynamic contents)

## Navigation

**Search for a dashboard by name**

There are two ways to open the dashboard search page. (Each takes you to the same search screen.)

- Click the {{icon.search}} icon in the main menu.
- Click the dashboard name in the navigation bar (top row, to the right of the {{icon.apps}} icon). (To search within the current folder, click the folder name instead of the dashboard name.)

![Search dashboards by name](../_images/PMM_Home_Dashboard_Search.jpg)

1. Click *Search dashboards by name* and begin typing any part of the dashboard name (in this example, "*Instances*").

2. Click one of the search results to go to that dashboard. Change the search text to refine the list.

3. To abandon the search, click the {{icon.times}} icon at the end of the search bar.

**Open a dashboard with the menu**

The [shortcut menu](#shortcut-menu) has links to commonly-used dashboards.

## Panels

Charts, graphs and set-based panels reveal extra information when the mouse is moved over them.

Some panels have an information icon {{icon.info}} in the top left corner. Mouse over this to reveal panel information.

### Panel menu

At the top of each panel and to the right of the panel name is the *panel menu*.

    The menu is hidden until you mouse over it. Look for the {{icon.angledown}} symbol in the title bar of a panel.
