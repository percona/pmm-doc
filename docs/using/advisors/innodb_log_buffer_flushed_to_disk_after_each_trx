InnoDB Flush Method May Not Be Optimal
======================================

\-----------------------------------------

Problem Description
-------------------

By default, InnoDB's log buffer is written out to the log file at each transaction commit and a flush-to-disk operation is performed on the log file, which enforces ACID compliance. In the event of a crash, if you can afford to lose a second's worth of transactions, you can achieve better performance by setting \_\_innodb\_flush\_log\_at\_trx\_commit\_\_ to either 0 or 2. If you set the value to 2, then only an operating system crash or a power outage can erase the last second of transactions. This can be very useful on slave servers, where the loss of a second's worth of data can be recovered from the master server if needed.
