## Definitions

- Alerts are generated when their criteria (*alert rules*) are met; an *alert* is the result of an *alert rule* expression evaluating to *true*.
- Alert rules are based on *alert rule templates*. We provide a default set of templates. You can also create your own.

!!! alert alert-info "Note"
    PMM's *Integrated Alerting* is a customized and separate instance of the Prometheus Alertmanager, and distinct from Grafana's alerting functionality.

## Prerequisites

Set up a communication channel: When the *Communication* tab appears, select it. Enter details for *Email* or *Slack*. ([Read more](../how-to/configure.md#advanced-settings))

## Open the *Integrated Alerting* page

- From the left menu, select {{ icon.bell }} *Alerting*, {{ icon.listul }} *Integrated Alerting*

!!! alert alert-info "Note"
    The *Alerting* menu also lists {{ icon.listul }} *Alert Rules* and {{ icon.commentshare }} *Notification Channels*. These are for Grafana's alerting functionality.

This page has four tabs.

1. *Alerts*: Shows alerts (if any).
