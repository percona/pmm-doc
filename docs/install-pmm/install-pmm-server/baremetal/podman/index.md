# Install PMM server with Podman on Docker image

This section provides instructions for running PMM Server with Podman based on our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server).

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    The tags used here are for the current release (PMM 2.33.0). Other [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server/tags) are available.

Podman is an open-source project available on most Linux platforms and resides on [GitHub](https://github.com/containers/podman). Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on your Linux System. 

Non-privileged users could run containers under the control of Podman.

It could be just aliased (`alias docker=podman`) with docker and work with the same way. All instructions from [Docker](../install-pmm-server/docker/index.md) section also apply here.

Percona recommends running PMM as a non-privileged user and running it as part of the SystemD service provided. SystemD service ensures that the service is running and maintains logs and other management features (start, stop, etc.).

## Before you start

- Install [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).
- Configure [rootless](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md)  Podman.

## Run as non-privileged user to start PMM

!!! note alert alert-primary "Availability"
    This feature is available starting with PMM 2.29.0.

??? info "Summary"

    !!! summary alert alert-info ""
        - Install.
        - Configure.
        - Enable and Start.
        - Open the PMM UI in a browser.

To run Podman as a non-privileged user:
{.power-number}

1. Install.

    Create `~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.service` file:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
    cat << "EOF" > ~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.service
    [Unit]
    Description=pmm-server
    Wants=network-online.target
    After=network-online.target
    After=nss-user-lookup.target nss-lookup.target
    After=time-sync.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    # set environment for this unit
    Environment=PMM_PUBLIC_PORT=8443
    Environment=PMM_VOLUME_NAME=%N
    Environment=PMM_TAG=2.33.0
    Environment=PMM_IMAGE=docker.io/percona/pmm-server
    Environment=PMM_ENV_FILE=%h/.config/pmm-server/pmm-server.env

    # optional env file that could override previous env settings for this unit
    EnvironmentFile=-%h/.config/pmm-server/env

    ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --rm --replace=true --name=%N -p ${PMM_PUBLIC_PORT}:443/tcp --ulimit=host --volume=${PMM_VOLUME_NAME}:/srv --env-file=${PMM_ENV_FILE} --health-cmd=none --health-interval=disable ${PMM_IMAGE}:${PMM_TAG}
    ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 10 %N
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=20

    [Install]
    Alias=%N
    WantedBy=default.target

    EOF
    ```

    Create `~/.config/pmm-server/pmm-server.env` file:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/pmm-server/
    cat << "EOF" > ~/.config/pmm-server/pmm-server.env
    # env file passed to the container
    # full list of environment variables:
    # https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/docker.html#environment-variables

    # keep updates disabled
    # do image replacement instead (update the tag and restart the service)
    DISABLE_UPDATES=1

    # Enable DBaaS feature
    #ENABLE_DBAAS=1
    EOF
    ```

2. Configure.

    There are 2 configuration files:
    1.  `~/.config/pmm-server/pmm-server.env` defines environment variables for PMM Server (PMM parameters like DBaaS feature and etc)
    2.  `~/.config/pmm-server/env` defines environment variables for SystemD service (image tags, repo and etc)

    SystemD service passes the environment parameters from the `pmm-server.env `file (in `~/.config/pmm-server/pmm-server.env`) to PMM. For more information about container environment variables, check [Docker Environment].

    SystemD service uses some environment variables that could be customized if needed:

    ```text
    Environment=PMM_PUBLIC_PORT=8443
    Environment=PMM_VOLUME_NAME=%N
    Environment=PMM_TAG=2.33.0
    Environment=PMM_IMAGE=docker.io/percona/pmm-server
    ```

    You can override the environment variables by defining them in the file  `~/.config/pmm-server/env`. For example, to override the path to a custom registry `~/.config/pmm-server/env`:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/pmm-server/
    cat << "EOF" > ~/.config/pmm-server/env
    PMM_TAG=2.31.0
    PMM_IMAGE=docker.io/percona/pmm-server
    PMM_PUBLIC_PORT=8443
    EOF
    ```

    !!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
        Ensure that you modify PMM_TAG in `~/.config/pmm-server/env` and update it regularly as Percona cannot update it. It needs to be done by you.

3. Enable and Start.

    ```sh
    systemctl --user enable --now pmm-server
    ```

4. Visit `https://localhost:8443` to see the PMM user interface in a web browser. (If you are accessing host remotely, replace `localhost` with the IP or server name of the host.)
