# Learn about some of our features

The following features make Percona Monitoring and Management a powerful tool for database administrators and DevOps teams to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of their database infrastructure.


1. **Query Analytics**: PMM provides insights into database query performance and enables you to identify slow queries, analyze query execution plans, and optimize them.

2. **Monitoring**: PMM comprehensively monitors the key performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, and other database-specific metrics. In addition to understanding the health of your database infrastructure, these metrics help you discover new patterns in database behavior and identify performance bottlenecks, regardless of where they are located or deployed.

3. **User-friendly dashboards**: PMM provides an intuitive graphical user interface with customizable dashboards that enable you to visualize and analyze your database's performance.

4. **Alerting**: It enables setting up alerts based on predefined thresholds for various metrics. When these thresholds are exceeded, PMM sends notifications via email or other channels, facilitating proactive management and quick resolution.

5. **Advisors**: Built-in Advisors run regular checks on the databases connected to PMM. The checks identify and alert you of potential security threats, performance degradation, data loss, and data corruption.

6. **Backup and restore**: 

- Spot critical performance issues faster, understand the root cause of incidents better, and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
- Zoom-in, drill-down database performance from node to single query levels. Perform in-depth troubleshooting and performance optimization.
- Create and configure database clusters no matter where the infrastructure is deployed.
- Back up your critical data with zero downtime and minimal performance impact. Schedule various backups (hot, incremental, physical) and restore databases up to a specific moment with Point-in-Time-Recovery. Technical preview feature.
- PMM can be used on-prem or on the cloud.
- In PMM, QAN helps ensure the database queries are executed as expected in the shortest time possible.
- The integration of PMM with tools like Prometheus aims to store information based on time.
- Time-based analysis for [MySQL](https://www.trustradius.com/products/mysql/reviews) and MongoDB servers confirms that your data works as efficiently as possible. We could improve database performance significantly.
