# Features

Following are the salient features of PMM:

- Monitor the health of your database infrastructure, explore new patterns in database behavior and manage and improve the performance of your databases no matter where they are located or deployed. PMM monitors databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- Monitor your database performance with customizable dashboards and real-time alerting.
- Spot critical performance issues faster, understand the root cause of incidents better, and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
- Zoom-in, drill-down database performance from node to single query levels. Perform in-depth troubleshooting and performance optimization.
- Built-in Advisors run regular checks of the databases connected to PMM. The checks identify and alert you of potential security threats, performance degradation, data loss, and data corruption.
- Create and configure database clusters no matter where the infrastructure is deployed.
- Back up your critical data with zero downtime and minimal performance impact. Schedule various backups (hot, incremental, physical) and restore databases up to a specific moment with Point-in-Time-Recovery. Technical preview feature.
- PMM can be used on-prem or on the cloud.
- In PMM, QAN helps ensure the database queries are executed as expected in the shortest time possible.
- The integration of PMM with tools like Prometheus aims to store information based on time.
- Time-based analysis for [MySQL](https://www.trustradius.com/products/mysql/reviews) and MongoDB servers confirms that your data works as efficiently as possible. We could improve database performance significantly.
