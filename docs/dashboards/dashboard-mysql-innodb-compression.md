# MySQL InnoDB Compression

This dashboard helps you analyze the efficiency of InnoDB compression.

## Compression level and failure rate threshold

**InnoDB Compression Level**

The level of zlib compression to use for InnoDB compressed tables and indexes.

**InnoDB Compression Failure Threshold**

The compression failure rate threshold for a table.

**Compression Failure Rate Threshold**

The maximum percentage that can be reserved as free space within each compressed
page, allowing room to reorganize the data and modification log within the page
when a compressed table or index is updated and the data might be recompressed.

**Write Pages to the Redo Log**

Specifies whether images of re-compressed pages are written to the redo
log. Re-compression may occur when changes are made to compressed data.

## Statistics of Compression Operations

This section contains the following metrics:


* Compress Attempts


* Uncompressed Attempts


* Compression Success Ratio

**Compress Attempts**

Number of compression operations attempted. Pages are compressed whenever an
empty page is created or the space for the uncompressed modification log runs
out.

**Uncompressed Attempts**

Number of uncompression operations performed. Compressed InnoDB pages are
uncompressed whenever compression fails, or the first time a compressed page is
accessed in the buffer pool and the uncompressed page does not exist.

## CPU Core Usage


* CPU Core Usage for Compression


* CPU Core Usage for Uncompression

## Buffer Pool Total


* Total Used Pages


* Total Free Pages

## Buffer Pool All


* Used Pages (Buffer Pool 0)


* Pages Free (Buffer Pool 0)
