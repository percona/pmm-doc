    Percona Alerting is the new Alerting feature introduced in PMM 2.31. This replaces the Integrated Alerting feature available in previous versions.  
    
Alerting notifies of important or unusual activity in your database environments so that you can identify and resolve problems quickly. When something needs your attention, PMM automatically sends you an alert through your specified contact points.
