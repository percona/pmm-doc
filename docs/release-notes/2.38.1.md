Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## Fixed issue

[PMM-12293](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12293) - The upgrade to Grafana  9.2.20 in PMM 2.38 fixed critical security [CVE-2023-3128](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/06/22/grafana-security-release-for-cve-2023-3128/) by changing the authentication mechanism to rely solely on the user's unique ID provided by the identity provider.

This change caused an authentication issue for second and subsequent connections to PMM using a Percona Account. With this PMM update, we are fixing this authentication issue to ensure that the "User already exists" error is no longer incorrectly displayed when users log back into PMM.


If you are using a third-party authentication provider and continue to see this issue, pass the **GF_AUTH_OAUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE_EMAIL_LOOKUP=1** environment variable to the PMM container. 

Alternatively, set the **oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup** config key in the **auth** section of the grafana.ini file. Keep in mind that any changes you make to this file are lost when upgrading PMM, so make sure to manually update this file after each upgrade
