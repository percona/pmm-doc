Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## Release Highlights

We have identified and fixed the [CVE-2023-3128](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/06/22/grafana-security-release-for-cve-2023-3128/) in PMM 2.38.1:

[PMM-12293](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12293) - The upgrade to Grafana  9.2.20 in PMM 2.38 fixed critical security [CVE-2023-3128](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/06/22/grafana-security-release-for-cve-2023-3128/) by changing the authentication mechanism to rely solely on the user's unique ID provided by the identity provider.

This change caused an authentication issue for second and subsequent connections to PMM using a Percona Account. With this PMM update, we are fixing this authentication issue to ensure that users can log back into PMM after an initial connection. Previously, this would fail with a "User already exists" error.

For detailed information about the issue and workaround, see [PMM-12293](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12293).
