Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## Fixed issue

[PMM-12293](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12293) - With this update, we are fixing an authentication issue that occurred when trying to relog into PMM using a Percona Account. Second and subsequent logins no longer result in a "User already exists" error.

If you are using a third-party authentication provider and continue to see this issue, pass the **GF_AUTH_OAUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE_EMAIL_LOOKUP=1** environment variable to the PMM container. Alternatively, set the **oauth_allow_insecure_email_lookup** config key in the **auth** section of the grafana.ini file. Keep in mind that any changes you make to this file are lost when upgrading PMM, so make sure to manually update this file after each upgrade.
