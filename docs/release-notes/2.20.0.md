Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- We've improved the [Easy-install script] for PMM Server by adding checksum verification. Installing PMM on a Linux machine is now even easier.
- PMM will use *Grafana 7.5* instead of 7.3. (Read more at [grafana.com].) We are also preparing for upgrades to Grafana 8.
- PostgreSQL monitoring with the `pg_stat_monitor` plugin enabled exposes some new metrics, such as Plan Times, WAL Fpi/Byles/Records.
- For users who use PMM through the AWS Marketplace, AWS RDS service discovery will be executed without AWS credentials and tuning the *AMI roles*. (LINK TO DOC)
