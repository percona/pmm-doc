(Previously, downloading and running new checks happened every 24 hours but the cycle didn't begin when STT was activated.)
* [PMM-7259](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7259): Integrated Alerting: 'Alerting is disabled' message gives hint to enable
* [PMM-7257](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7257): Integrated Alerting: Cleaner rule details in Alert Rules list, API to expose Alert Rule's expression and real values
* [PMM-7240](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7240): DBaaS: Change from Dashboard to Grafana Page -- We changed the DBaaS page from a Grafana Dashboard to a Grafana Page to be better aligned with the DBaaS enable/disable status and avoid confusion when DBaaS is disabled.
* [PMM-6711](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6711): Add filter for `external_group` in `pmm-managed` services list (API)

Instead, use the `:2` tag. ([Read more](../setting-up/server/docker.md#run-pmm-server-as-a-docker-image).)
* [PMM-4306](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4306): Ability to execute `pt-mongodb-summary` for MongoDB service (API)
* [PMM-7472](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7472): Remove Prometheus datasource -- If you were using custom dashboards with a specified Datasource (not using empty to use default one) you may need to edit your dashboards to use the proper Datasource.
  PMM is no longer using Prometheus but uses compatible storage for metrics from VictoriaMetrics. We renamed the datasource to be more technology-agnostic.
