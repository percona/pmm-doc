Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## New Features

* [PMM-4172](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4172), [PMM-4306](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4306), [PMM-5784](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5784): Ability to execute `pt-pg-summary` for PostgreSQL service, `pt-mongodb-summary` for MongoDB service, and `pt-mysql-summary` for MySQL service
* [PMM-7177](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7177): Dashboards: New Grafana panel combining `pt-mysql-summary`, `pt-mongodb-summary`, `pt-pg-summary` outputs
* [PMM-7123](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7123): Add `external-serverless` instances
* [PMM-7405](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7405): Check connection response format when adding External Service to monitoring
* [PMM-7419](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7419): DBaaS: Ability to see DB Cluster creation/modification logs
* [PMM-7266](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7266): DBaaS: Cluster creation progress bar -- You can now see the progress of DBaaS DB cluster creation. (The progress bar is based on the number of back-end technical steps, not the time required to perform the tasks.)
* [PMM-6797](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6797): HAProxy monitoring: Ability to add HAProxy services with `pmm-admin [inventory] add [service] haproxy` command
* [PMM-7487](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7487): HAProxy monitoring: Check connection to HAProxy services when adding them for monitoring
* [PMM-7496](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7496): HAProxy monitoring: New HAProxy PXC dashboards
* [PMM-6943](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6943): HAProxy monitoring: Show HAProxy type services in PMM Inventory
* [PMM-6924](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6924): Integrated Alerting : Show 'breadcrumbs' navigation aid on non-dashboard pages as well as Grafana dashboard pages
* [PMM-7294](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7294): Integrated Alerting: Pagination for viewing large numbers of Alert Rules
* [PMM-7417](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7417): Security Threat Tool: Show list of all available security checks
* [PMM-7418](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7418): Security Threat Tool: Ability to disable specific security checks



## Improvements

* [PMM-5533](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5533): Better indentation of columns in `pmm-admin list` output
* [PMM-7240](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7240): DBaaS: Change from Dashboard to Grafana Page -- We changed the DBaaS page from a Grafana Dashboard to a Grafana Page to be better aligned with the DBaaS enable/disable status and avoid confusion when DBaaS is disabled.
* [PMM-4679](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4679): Docker: Tag `pmm-server`, `pmm-client` images with `:latest` -- Docker images for `pmm-client` and `pmm-server` are tagged `:latest` for the most recent release. **These should not** be used in production environments. Instead, use the `:2` tag.
* [PMM-5888](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5888): Improve `pmm-admin --help` descriptions for external services
* [PMM-6693](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6693): pmm-managed denies request when using API keys even if the role set is admin -- The PMM API will now accept requests not only with username/password but also with API tokens generated in Grafana.
* [PMM-6711](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6711): Add filter for `external_group` in `pmm-managed` services list
* [PMM-7257](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7257): Integrated Alerting: Easier-to-read rule details in Alert Rules list (API to expose Alert Rule's expression and real values)
* [PMM-7259](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7259): Integrated Alerting: 'Alerting is disabled' message gives user-friendly hint and links explaining how to enable it
* [PMM-7328](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7328): Security Threat Tool: Download and run checks when activated, immediately, repeating every 24 hours thereafter (Previously, downloading and running new checks happened every 24 hours but the cycle didn't begin when STT was activated.)
* [PMM-7329](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7329): Security Threat Tool: Hide check results tab if STT is disabled
* [PMM-7331](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7331): Security Threat Tool: Failed checks have 'Read more' links with helpful content
* [PMM-7422](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7422): Security Threat Tool: View all active and silenced alerts
* [PMM-7472](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7472): Remove Prometheus datasource -- If you were using custom dashboards with a specified Datasource (not using empty to use default one) you may need to edit your dashboards to use the proper Datasource. PMM is no longer using Prometheus but uses compatible storage for metrics from VictoriaMetrics. We renamed the datasource to be more technology-agnostic.
* [PMM-6695](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6695): Software update: Grafana 7.1.3 to 7.3.7 (See [What's new in Grafana 7.2](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v7-2) and [What's new in Grafana 7.3](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v7-3/).)
* [PMM-7471](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7471): Software update: VictoriaMetrics 1.52.0 to 1.53.1 (See [VictoriaMetrics 1.53.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.53.0) and [VictoriaMetrics 1.53.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.53.1).)
