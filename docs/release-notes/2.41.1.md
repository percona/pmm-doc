| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/pmm/quickstart) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.


## Release Highlights

### Improved support for Arbiter nodes

We've made it easier to add MongoDB Arbiter nodes to PMM, as it no longer requires workarounds for cases where authorization is enabled on the MongoDB replica set. Additionally, Arbiter nodes are now displayed correctly on the dashboards.

### New Metric for MongoDB Exporters

We've added a new metric to our MongoDB exporters: `mongodb_shards_collection_chunks_count`. This metric is available for sharded Mongo instances, offering insights into the distribution of collection chunks across different shards. Explore and leverage this metric to enhance your understanding of your sharded MongoDB setup.


## New Features


## Improvements
[PMM-12712](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12712) - MongoDB sharded cluster metrics now include new metrics to represent database and collection distribution across different shards. This helps gain insights into the overall balance of shards within MongoDB setups.

## Components upgrade


## Bugs Fixed
- [PMM-12621](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12621) - [Dashboards] Added support for the Anonymous mode to show all Service types on the main menu. This ensures users can access the dashboards, even when PMM is configured in Anonymous mode.
- [PMM-12425](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12425) - [QAN]: The **Absolute time range** time picker on the **Query Analytics (QAN)** page no longer displays an error when using 'now' instead of a specific timestamp for filtering dashboard data.
- [PMM-12473](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12473) - Fixed monitoring of external services when query string parameters are passed to `--metrics-path`.
