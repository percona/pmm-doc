## Release Highlights

We have identified and fixed CVE-2023-34409 in PMM 2.37.1:

[PMM-12182](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12182): PMM authentication bypass vulnerability

**Workaround**

If you are unable to update PMM you can resolve this issue as follows:

1. Make changes to the NGINX configuration on the running PMM instance. To do so, create a Bash script with [the code from this script on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm/main/scripts/authfix.sh). 

2. Apply the code using this `docker` command on a server running the PMM Docker container (as root or using sudo):
    ```sh
    docker exec -it pmm-server bash -c 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm/main/scripts/authfix.sh  | /bin/bash '
    ```
3. If you are running PMM via a virtual appliance (OVF or AMI), use SSH to shell into the PMM server and run this command:
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm/main/scripts/authfix.sh  | /bin/bash
    ```
