Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- Switch to push metrics by default

    In PMM v2.12.0, Percona replaced its metrics collection service (formerly Prometheus) with VictoriaMetrics. Historically, PMM used a “pull” method with Prometheus. VictoriaMetrics can operate in either a “pull” or “push” method. When PMM v2.12.0 was released, Percona kept the method as “pull”. Now with PMM v2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to “push”. This [blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/01/foiled-by-the-firewall-a-tale-of-transition-from-prometheus-to-victoriametrics/) describes the two methods and why “push” benefits its users. Also, [here is a post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/16/percona-monitoring-and-management-migration-from-prometheus-to-victoriametrics-faq/) by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the “push” model. Documentation on the “push” method is [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/victoria-metrics.html).

- DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical  Preview)

    DBaaS enables non-DBAs (software architects, developers, site reliability engineers, etc.) to perform typical DBA tasks to manage an organization’s database environment via user interfaces and automation orchestration.

    **Note**: This capability is “feature-flagged” and turned off by default. Users require a variable to be passed to PMM to expose this functionality.

- Pass configured SSL certificates to connect PMM for MongoDB

    Enables PMM administrators to setup configured SSL certificate “keys” to authenticate the connection to PMM, specifically for setting up MongoDB. This is a critical security requirement especially in large enterprise infrastructure environments.

- External services presentation on node summary dashboard

    Improvements to the user experience for adding and viewing external services (any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus export such as: non-Percona supported databases like Reddis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization’s external application) on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM.


## New Features

* [PMM-5765](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5765): Add external serverless service (no host or address) with new 'pmm-admin add external-serverless' option
* [PMM-6941](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6941): Integrated Alerting: Ability to delete an 'Alert Rule Template'



## Improvements

* [PMM-7145](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7145): 'Push' metrics mode is default when adding services and nodes (All agents collecting data from Services and Nodes will now use PUSH model if not specified explicitly. You will still be able to use '-metrics-mode' flag to use Pull metrics if needed. All previously set up agents will keep their existing mode. To change these you need to remove and re-add them.)
* [PMM-7282](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7282): Integrated Alerting: Ability to create rule without channels and filters
* [PMM-7082](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7082): Integrated Alerting: Severity levels are color-coded
* [PMM-7065](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7065): Integrated Alerting: Show rule details for items in Alert Rules list
