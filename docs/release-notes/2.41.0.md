## Release Highlights

### Continuous data collection during outages

PMM data is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting. PMM operates on a client-server architecture, exchanging data between clients (on database servers) and servers (PMM UI interface and data storage). If the PMM connection was interrupted by network or application issues in the previous versions of PMM, the system could not collect complete data, resulting in data loss. This issue has been addressed in PMM 2.41.0. If the PMM client and server components encounter connection problems, the data gathered during these periods is stored and transmitted immediately after the connection is restored.

PMM users can now investigate challenging and complex problems, thus providing a deeper understanding of database and network issues.

### Streamlined database problem reporting to Percona

Effective database problem resolution relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of issue reporting.

To improve the process of gathering and sharing PMM metrics and data, we've now integrated the [pmm_dump client utility](https://docs.percona.com/pmm-dump-documentation/index.html) into PMM. Originally a standalone client for PMM Server, this now readily accessible within the PMM user interface.

This integration enables you to effortlessly collect data from PMM and empowers our Support team to better assist customers in solving database issues in SLA and address community-reported bugs in Jira.

To get started, go to the **Help** section on the main menu > **PMM Dump** and choose to either export a dataset locally or upload it via an SFTP server using the credentials generated through your Percona Support ticket.

### PostgreSQL monitoring performance improvement

In our continuing efforts to improve PMM, we recognize the significance of performance and its impact on our users. Starting with PMM 2.41.0, we have optimized resource usage for PostgreSQL users. This has been accomplished by reducing the number of connections used in monitoring.

### PMM DBaaS functionality evolution into Percona Everest

We have achieved positive outcomes in developing PMM's Database-as-a-Service feature. As we move to the next level, we have decided to separate the DBaaS functionality into an independent product. Consequently, we are discontinuing the DBaaS functionality in PMM and offering a [migration path to Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest-guide).

While the DBaaS functionality will remain available in PMM v2, all future updates and enhancements will be exclusively accessible through the Percona Everest interface.
We strongly recommend you try [Percona Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest) for a more streamlined and robust experience with database deployments.

## New Features

[PMM-8655](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8655) - Alongside Victoria metrics, PMM now also captures QAN data during network outages. Once the connection is restored, all accumulated data is promptly delivered, ensuring you have comprehensive information to work with across your instances.
[PMM-12459](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12459) - The [pmm_dump client utility](https://docs.percona.com/pmm-dump-documentation/index.html) previously available as a standalone client for PMM Server is now readily accessible within the PMM user interface. 
[PMM-12463](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12463) - [Telemetry] Collecting information about env variables usage in PMM

## Improvements

[PMM-11341](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11341) - PMM 2.41.0 introduces limit for Auto-discovery in PostgreSQL, a feature that dynamically discovers all databases in your PostgreSQL instance. Limiting Auto-discovery reduces connections and prevents high CPU and RAM usage caused by multiple databases.
[PMM-12375](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12375) - Starting with PMM 2.41.0, each instance of a service gets a `version` attribute to the response of the endpoint that provides a list of services being monitored by PMM.
[PMM-12422](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12422) - Starting with PMM 2.41.0, a new flag called `--expose-exporter-address` has been introduced. When you enable this flag and set the metrics mode to **push**, the node exporter for that agent will use the IP address `0.0.0.0`. This means that any IP address, either from a local system or from anywhere on the internet, can access it. If the flag is not enabled, the node exporter will use the address `127.0.0.1`, the default name for the computer you are working on, or the localhost.
[PMM-12544](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12544) - Added deprecation notice to the DBaaS pages, to advise about the evolution of PMM DBaaS functionality into [Percona Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest).
[PMM-12549](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12549) - Added support for the new MongoDB version, which means you can use PMM to monitor MongoDB 7 databases.
## Components upgrade

- [PMM-12154](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12154) - postgres_exporter has been updated to version [0.14.0](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/releases).
- [PMM-12223](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12223) - Updated Clickhouse to v22.8.


## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-4712](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4712) - We have addressed the issue where the [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) heap reports were missing. As a result, you can investigate out-of-memory issues more efficiently and precisely.
- [PMM-12576](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12576) - After upgrading to PMM 2.40.0, changing the Admin userâ€™s password from the terminal was not functioning. The issue has been resolved now.
- [PMM-12626](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12626) - The GO version that we used to build PMM was updated to the latest version to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- [PMM-12658](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12658) - Corrected a typo in the MongoDB cluster summary dashboard.
