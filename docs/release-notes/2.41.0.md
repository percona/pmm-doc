## Release Highlights

### Continuous data collection during network and application issues

PMM data is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting. PMM operates on a client-server architecture, exchanging data between clients (on database servers) and servers (PMM UI interface and data storage). If the PMM connection was interrupted by network or application issues in the previous versions of PMM, the system could not collect complete data, resulting in data loss. This issue has been addressed in PMM 2.41.0. If the PMM Client and Server components encounter connection problems, the data gathered during these periods is stored and delivered immediately after the connection is restored.

PMM users can now investigate challenging and complex problems, thus providing a deeper understanding of database and network issues.

### Streamlined database problem reporting to Percona

Effective database problem resolution relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of issue reporting.

To improve the process of gathering and sharing PMM metrics and data, we've now integrated the [pmm_dump client utility](https://docs.percona.com/pmm-dump-documentation/index.html) into PMM. Originally a standalone client for PMM Server, this now readily accessible within the PMM user interface.

This integration enables you to effortlessly collect data from PMM and empowers our Support team to better assist customers in solving database issues in SLA and address community-reported bugs in Jira.

To get started, go to the **Help** section on the main menu > **PMM Dump** and choose to either export a dataset locally or upload it via an SFTP server using the credentials generated through your Percona Support ticket.

### PostgreSQL monitoring performance improvement

In our continuing efforts to improve PMM, we recognize the significance of performance and its impact on our users. Starting with PMM  2.41.0, we have optimized resource usage for PostgreSQL users. This has been accomplished by reducing the number of connections used in monitoring.

### PMM DBaaS functionality evolution into Percona Everest

We have achieved positive outcomes in developing PMM's Database-as-a-Service feature. As we move to the next level, we have decided to separate the DBaaS functionality into an independent product. Consequently, we are discontinuing the DBaaS functionality in PMM and offering a [migration path to Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest-guide).

While the DBaaS functionality will remain available in PMM v2, all future updates and enhancements will be exclusively accessible through the Percona Everest interface.
We strongly recommend you try [Percona Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest) for a more streamlined and robust experience with database deployments.

## New Features

- [PMM-8655](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8655) - Alongside Victoria metrics, PMM now also captures QAN data during network outages. Once the connection is restored, all accumulated data is promptly delivered, ensuring you have comprehensive information to work with across your instances.
