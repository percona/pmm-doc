## Release Highlights
### Data collection is now can survive temporary Network problems between Database and PMM server 
PMM data is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting by its users. The PMM application operates through a client-server system, exchanging data between clients (on DB servers) and servers (PMM UI interface and data storage). Previously, when network or application issues interrupted this connection, PMM could not collect complete data. However, with this latest release, such problems with the PMM Client and Server components will no longer result in data loss. Instead, data gathered during the connection problem will be delivered immediately once the connection is re-established. This new feature will allow PMM users to investigate problems that previously could not be examined, providing a clearer understanding of database or network problems.


### Streamlined database problem reporting to Percona

Effective database problem resolution relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of issue reporting. 

To improve the process of gathering and sharing PMM metrics and data, we've now integrated the [pmm_dump client utility](https://docs.percona.com/pmm-dump-documentation/index.html) into PMM. Originally a standalone client for PMM Server, this now readily accessible within the PMM user interface. 

This integration enables you to effortlessly collect data from PMM and empowers our Support team to better assist customers in solving database issues in SLA and address community-reported bugs in Jira. 

To get started, go to the **Help** section on the main menu > **PMM Dump** and choose to either export a dataset locally or upload it via an FTP server using your Percona Support credentials.

 
### PostgreSQL monitoring performance improvement
At our company, we prioritize the principle of "Do no Harm" and recognize that performance is a crucial aspect of our work. With this release, we have addressed a common problem for our PostgreSQL users regarding efficient resource usage by PMM. Specifically, we have decreased the number of used connections for monitoring, resulting in improved efficiency.

### PMM DBaaS functionality evolution into Percona Everest
We have achieved positive outcomes in developing PMM's Database-as-a-Service feature. As we move to the next level, we have decided to separate the DBaaS functionality into an independent product. Consequently, we are discontinuing the DBaaS functionality in PMM and offering a [migration path to Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest-guide).

While the DBaaS functionality will remain available in PMM v2, all future updates and enhancements will be exclusively accessible through the Percona Everest interface.
We strongly recommend you try [Percona Everest](http://per.co.na/pmm-to-everest) for a more streamlined and robust experience with database deployments.
