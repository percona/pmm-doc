    We recommend using the latest version of the PMM instance. This ensures that you access the latest features of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place. One of the critical features of VictoriaMetrics is [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode), which enhances the performance of PMM and saves memory when scraping targets expose millions of metrics.
