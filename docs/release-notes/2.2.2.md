[Percona Monitoring and Management](/) (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

For *PMM* install instructions, see [Installing PMM Server](../install/index-server.md) and [Installing PMM Client](../install/index-client.md).

!!! note

    PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation — your existing
PMM 1 environment can’t be upgraded to this version.

## Improvements and new features


* [PMM-5321](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5321): The optimization of the Query Analytics parser code for
PostgreSQL queries allowed us to reduce the memory resources consumption by
1-5%, and the parsing time of an individual query by 30-40%


* [PMM-5184](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5184): The `pmm-admin summary` command have gained a new
`--skip-server` flag which makes it operating in a local-only mode, creating
summary file without contacting the PMM Server

## Fixed bugs


* [PMM-5340](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5340): The Scraping Time Drift graph on the Prometheus dashboard
was showing wrong values because the actual metrics resolution wasn’t taken
into account


* [PMM-5060](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5060): Qery Analytics Dashboard did not show the row with the last
query of the first page, if the number of queries to display was 11
