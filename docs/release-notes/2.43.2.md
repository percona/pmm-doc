##  PostgreSQL 17 support for Query Analytics (QAN)

This patch release adds PostgreSQL 17 support for Query Analytics with updates to the `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_monitor` extensions.

To align with PostgreSQL 17 standards, we've renamed the `blk_read_time` field to `shared_blk_read_time` and the `blk_write_time` field to `shared_blk_write_time`.

All dashboards reflect these changes, and the API supports both old and new field names, for backwords compatibility.

## Fixed: High memory consumption in MongoDB exporter

We have also updated the MongoDB exporter to address a critical issue present in version 2.43.1 where unclosed connections led to increasingly high memory consumption over time.

This resolves the *`Failed to get PBM configuration`* error that contributed to memory issues, and significantly reduces the rate of increase in total memory allocations.
