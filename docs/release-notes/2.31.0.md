    We recommend using the latest version of PMM. This ensures that you have access to the latest PMM features and that your environment runs on the latest version of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place.

## Release Highlights


### Enhaced query building, navigation and Alerting

We have upgraded Grafana to version 9.1 in PMM 2.31.0. With this upgrade, you can get a simplified user interface, enhanced visualizations, and a default unified Alerting experience. For more information, see What’s new in Grafana.
 
The following features have been introduced with PMM 2.31.0:
 
- **Expandable navbar (main menu)**
 
    For an enhanced user experience and better accessibility, the main menu has been expanded with crucial elements such as starred dashboards, system, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, ProxySQL, and HAProxy which makes it 
 
- **Prometheus Query Builder**

    A new UI query builder has been introduced, by which you can write Prometheus queries effortlessly. Prometheus queries can be complex to grasp, but with this Grafana release in PMM, it becomes easier. 

- **Improvements to dashboard search**
    
    The dashboards can now be searched by panel title as well as dashboard title. Also, the overall performance has been enhanced as querying and sorting have become much faster.


### General availability of Percona Alerting

With this release, we are streamlining the PMM alert setup process with an overhauled, unified alerting system based on Grafana. 

All previous Integrated Alerting and Grafana Alerting functionality are now consolidated in a single pane of glass on the **Alerting** page. From here, you can configure, create and monitor alerts based on Percona or Grafana templates. 

The **Alert Rules** tab has also evolved into a more efficient interface with an added layer for simplifying complex Grafana rules. You’ll find that the new **Percona templated alert** option here offers the same functionality available in the old Integrated Alerting, but uses a friendlier interface, powered by Grafana’s advanced alerting capabilities. 

As an important and generally useful feature, this new Alerting feature is now enabled by default and ready to use in production! 

### Deprecated Integrated Alerting
The new Percona Alerting feature fully replaces the old Integrated Alerting in previous PMM versions. The new alerting brings full feature parity with Integrated Alerting, along with additional benefits like Grafana-based alert rules and a unified alerting command center. 

If you have been using Integrated Alerting in the previous PMM version, your custom alert rule templates will be automatically migrated to PMM 2.31. After upgrading to this new version, you will find all your alert templates under **Alerting > Alert Templates**. 
These templates are also available for creating new alert rules using the new Percona Templated Alerts option on the Alert Rules tab. 

However, custom alert rules created with Integrated Alerting are not automatically migrated to Percona Alerting. After upgrading, make sure to manually migrate any custom alert rules that you want to transfer to PMM 2.31 using the script that will be provided soon. 


## Vacuum monitoring dashboard

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    These experimental dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.


A new experimental dashboard has been introduced to overcome the difficulties related to vacuum by providing them with the correct and timely insights.

This dashboard contains the following:

- Dead tuples - Identifies the number of dead rows in each table even though the rows are physically removed from the table.

- Last time vacuum ran - Tracks the last time a vacuum or autovacuum process successfully ran on each of your tables.

- Number of rows modified since last Analyze - The number of rows changed since the last time ANALYZE ran.

- Manual vacuum events - Tracks the number of times a manual vacuum was run on each table. 

- Table disk usage - Tracking the disk space used by each table is crucial as it enables you to gauge expected changes in the query performance over time—but it can also help you detect potential vacuuming-related issues.


## New official (GA) deployment method - Podman 

We are excited to announce the General Availability (GA) of Podman support for Deploying PMM 2.31.0. We had introduced it in 2.29.0 as a preview feature, but now we are production ready with this feature.


## New Alerting

Percona Alerting is a solution based on Grafana Alerting with the addition of simplicity of Templates usage.  
This will enable users to use Alerting without deep knowledge of metrics details and consume the best knowledge from Percona Experts who created Alerting Templates. 



### Simplied deployment with Database as a Service (DBaaS)

In our constant endeavor and focus on an enhanced user experience, in PMM 2.31.0, we have simplified the deployment and configuration of DBaaS as follows:

- With PMM 2.31.0, you can easily add a DB cluster from the newly created K8s cluster. All the DB cluster window fields are auto-populated with the values based on the existing K8s cluster. 

- For PMM 2.31.0, while accessing DbaaS, if you have an existing Kubernetes cluster configured for DBaaS, you will be automatically redirected to the DB Cluster page. Otherwise, you would be redirected to the Kubernetes Cluster page.

- PMM now supports Percona Operator for MongoDB [1.12.0](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/RN/Kubernetes-Operator-for-PSMONGODB-RN1.12.0.html).
