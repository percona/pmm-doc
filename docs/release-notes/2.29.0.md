    We recommend using the latest version of PMM. This ensures that you have access to the latest PMM features and that your environment runs on the latest version of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place.

## Release Highlights

### New user onboarding

PMM now includes a short in-app tutorial that automatically pops up when you first launch the application. 
If you are a new user, this is your virtual unboxing of key PMM features to help you get started easier. 
If you are an Intermediate or Advanced user, use the tour as a checklist of features worth exploring to make sure you’re making the most out of your PMM. 


### Extended ways of depoying PMM in various environments**

- PMM in k8s: [Technical Preview]: With PMM 2.29.0 scale and deploy your PMM instances faster using the Kubernetes clusters. 
- Podman support: [Technical Preview]: Starting PMM 2.29.0, deploy your PMM instances more securely using Podman as it does not require root access. Also, obtain more control over the layers of the container with Podman.
- Start PMM without Data container: It's now simpler to start PMM without a data container using your file system. You can access your files directly from your local file system.
- RHEL 9 support (client): “New version of RHEL released and we following our policy to provide packages to the latest  supported OS”

### Monitoring

- Meta metrics: Additional metrics for Mongodb exporters to monitor the time it takes to collect data from different collectors. This allows you to identify the monitoring costs for various collectors by MongoDB exporters.
- PXC Cluster Dashboard: [Experimental]: Restructured the PXC cluster Dashboard to make it intuitive and user-friendly. Important data for the PXC cluster is put together in this dashboard to obtain feedback from our users.


### Troubleshooting and operations improvement

- Logs verbosity management: Pronounced control over the logs you want to view with the flexibility to choose options such as warning, error, and fatal with the --log-level parameter.
- More details and targets in commands 
- Ppof data collection: Obtain profiling data from the PMM server with the pprof parameter in the pmm-admin summary enabling you to generate reports in textual and graphical formats for visualizing and analyzing data.

## New Features

- [PMM-10133](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10133): New User Onboarding: For an enhanced user experience and explicitly keeping the new user's requirements in mind, added a guided user onboarding tour that guides you over the main PMM components on your first onboarding journey.

- [PMM-10059](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10059): Advisors: Use filters to explore available advisors checks. As we’re constantly adding more advisors for checking the health of your connected databases, you may find it useful to now be able to drill down through this constantly growing list.              
Use the filters on the Advisors Checks > All Checks page to search advisors by Name, Description, Status or Interval. If you need to share the filtered results with your team members, send them the PMM URL which saves your search criteria and results. 

- [PMM-7110](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7110) - You can now obtain profiling data with the pprof tool that helps analyze CPU, Memory usage, heap size, and thread count for your PMM components.

- [PMM-8660](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8660): Easier access to your Percona Support Specialist - If you are a Percona customer, you can now find the contact details of your dedicated Percona Support Specialist on the new Environment Overview tab on the main menu.

- [PMM-7925](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7925): [Technical Preview]: Starting PMM 2.29.0, you can now deploy your PMM instances using Podman, which is considered far more secure as it does not require root access. Also, with Podman, you can exercise control over the layers of the container.

- [PMM-9613](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9613): [Technical Preview]: You can now scale and deploy your PMM instances faster using the Kubernetes clusters. 

- [PMM-9919](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9919): We have now added some additional metrics to Mongodb exporters to monitor the time it takes to collect data for different collectors that would allow us to identify the monitoring cost of various collectors by MongoDB exporters.

## Known Issues

[PMM-9992](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9992): **Error while using reverse proxy (like Nginx)**

While using a reverse proxy (for example, Nginx) in front of PMM, you can run into the error `origin not allowed` after upgrading to PMM 2.27.0 or newer versions.

**Solution**

Add the Host header to the reverse proxy config file.

**Example** 

For Nginx, add the following:

`proxy_set_header Host $http_host;`
