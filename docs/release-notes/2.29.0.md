| **Installation:** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/pmm/quickstart) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    We recommend using the latest version of PMM. This ensures that you have access to the latest PMM features and that your environment runs on the latest version of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place.

## Release Highlights

### Guided tour of PMM

PMM now includes a short in-app tutorial that automatically pops up when you first launch the application. 
If you are a new user, this is your virtual unboxing of key PMM features to help you get started easier. 
If you are an Intermediate or Advanced user, use the tour as a checklist of features worth exploring to make sure you’re making the most out of your PMM. 


### Depoying PMM in various environments

#### K8s

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Disclaimer"
    Deploying PMM is Kubernetes is still under Preview and, as such, subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.

Starting PMM 2.29.0, we have introduced the [helm](https://helm.sh/) chart to seamlessly deploy your PMM instances on the k8s, a prominent container orchestration ecosystem. 

With the deployment of your PMM instances on K8s, you can experience its power-packed features such as high scalability, availability, portability, extensibility, no development caveat, and much more.

#### Podman

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Disclaimer"
    Podman support is still under Preview and, as such, subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.

Starting PMM 2.29.0, get your PMM instances up and running quickly with the Podman. Deployment with the Podman is far more secure as it does not require root privileges. Also, with Podman, you can exercise control over the layers of the container.

#### Local file system

You can now start your PMM instances without a data container using your local file system. 

You can use docker volume or host directory with the `-v docker-cli` option for storing PMM state (databases, configs, etc.)

- RHEL 9 support (client): “New version of RHEL released and we following our policy to provide packages to the latest  supported OS”

### Monitoring

#### Meta metrics

The following metrics have been exposed as part of PMM 2.29.0 for MongoDB exporter:

- Uptime
- File descriptors in use
- Memory usage
- Exporter errors
- Scrape rate
- Service availability check

Also, we have added some metrics for Mongodb exporters to monitor the time it takes to collect data for different collectors. This would allow us to identify the monitoring cost of various collectors by MongoDB exporters. 


#### PXC Cluster dashboard:

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    This experimental dashboard is subject to change. It is recommended to use this dashboards for testing purposes only.

Created a new experimental dashboard for PXC Cluster Summary to make it simple, intuitive, and provide at-a-glance visibility for better decision making. Important data for the PXC cluster is put together in this dashboard to obtain feedback from our users.

Before this, the PXC Cluster data was distributed over different dashboards. The users had to browse the MySQL compare dashboard to check the data like slow queries, and network overview that was not in the PXC nodes compare dashboard, which made it time-consuming to identify any possible issues with the database.

### Troubleshooting

#### Logs management

As a PMM user, you can explicitly set a detailed level of logging so that, by default, you will have fewer logs to see, thereby enhancing your troubleshooting experience. 

You have more control over the logs you want to view with the `--log-level` parameter with the flexibility to choose options such as warning, error, fatal, and info.

#### Additional details added in commands

Added the Agent (exporter) ports to the following pmm-admin commands that is essentially required for debugging: 

- `pmm-admin list`
- `pmm-admin status`
- `pmm-admin inventory list agents`


#### Ppof data collection: Obtain profiling data from the PMM server with the pprof parameter in the pmm-admin summary enabling you to generate reports in textual and graphical formats for visualizing and analyzing data.


### Percona Platform Integration

#### Terminate Percona Platform connections as an Admin
When regular users are not able to disconnect a server (for example when PMM was moved to a network segment without outbound connections to public networks), PMM Admins can now terminate such connections instead.

The **Disconnect** option under **Settings > Percona Platform** now enables PMM Admins to retire PMM instances from Percona Platform even if they are not logged in with a Percona Account.

When disconnecting servers without a Percona Account, the lingering servers are not automatically removed from the list of PMM instances in Percona Platform. As a Percona Platform Admin, you can ensure that your list of PMM instances stays up-to-date by manually removing those unavailable servers via [PMM instances](https://portal.percona.com/login).

#### Easier access to your Percona Support Specialist 
If you are a Percona customer, you can now find the contact details of your dedicated Percona Support Specialist on the new ![!clouds](../_images/clouds.png) **Environment Overview** tab on the main menu.

The **Percona Contacts** section here shows the name and email of the Customer Success Manager assigned to your organization, who can help with any PMM queries.
This new tab will soon be populated with more useful information about your PMM environment.


### Advisors
#### Extended severities for advisor checks and alerts
We have extended and unified the list of severity levels for the notifications coming from Integrated Alerting and Advisor Checks. 
When you create a new alert rule, you can now choose from a wider range of severity labels: **Emergency**, **Alert**, **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Notice**, **Info**, **Debug**. 

The same severities are now also available for notifications coming from failed checks under **Advisor Checks > Failed Checks**. We’ve also made a small UX improvement to the way failed checks are grouped by severity in the table.

#### Use filters to explore available advisors checks
As we’re constantly adding more advisors for checking the health of your connected databases, you may find it useful to now be able to drill-down through this constantly growing list.    

Use the filters on the **Advisors Checks > All Checks** page to search advisors by **Name**, **Description**, **Status** or **Interval**. If you need to share the filtered results with your team members, send them the PMM URL which saves your search criteria and results. 

### DBaaS

Simplified the API such that it requires fewer parameters to run the API. Also, enhanced the documentation.

### Exporters

Updated the MySQL exporter.

### Components upgrade

 - Upgraded VictoriaMetrics operatot to version 0.24.
 - Upgraded the ClickHouse plugin to 2.4.4 which fixes some of the CVEs.
 - Added RHEL 9 support for PMM client.
 - With this release, we are upgrading grpc-gateway to version 2.0, which deprecates the error field in error responses. If you are using the PMM API, make sure to replace this with the new message field from the Google Cloud API Error model.

## Known Issues

[PMM-9992](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9992): **Error while using reverse proxy (like Nginx)**

While using a reverse proxy (for example, Nginx) in front of PMM, you can run into the error `origin not allowed` after upgrading to PMM 2.27.0 or newer versions.

**Solution**

Add the Host header to the reverse proxy config file.

**Example** 

For Nginx, add the following:

`proxy_set_header Host $http_host;`
