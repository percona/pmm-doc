## Known Issues

[PMM-9992](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9992): **Error while using reverse proxy (like Nginx)**

While using a reverse proxy (for example, Nginx) in front of PMM, you can run into the error `origin not allowed` after upgrading to PMM 2.27.0 or newer versions.

**Solution**

Add the Host header to the reverse proxy config file.

**Example** 

For Nginx, add the following:

`proxy_set_header Host $http_host;`
