Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- Custom Certificates support for MySQL monitoring, including remote monitoring, will let you monitor MySQL instances with such security restrictions. This functionality might help monitor Google Cloud SQL for MySQL instances easier.

- External monitoring cleanups on UI to make it easier to use. You can fill all parameters or provide the URL of your endpoint, and PMM will detect all needed parts.

- pg_stat_monitor 0.9.0 support. This change will give you compatibility with the latest version. More features coming later

- Single-line install of PMM Server on supported Linux distros   (this feature is in Technical Preview).

- DBaaS Changes: (this feature is in Technical Preview)
    - DBaaS is now is better open for the public, so you can quickly turn it ON  on the Advanced settings page.  (LINK to DOC)
    - Database components management will enable PMM administrators to restrict some DB versions from creating DB Clusters.
    - For PXC clusters created using DBaaS, the HAProxy will be used by default.  Please note: the proper monitoring HAProxy with DBaaS will come later.

- Sign in to Percona Platform changes. Starting from this release, Registration of the Percona account will be more secured and require additional confirmation.
