## Release Highlights

### Important security updates

- As security is paramount to us, starting with PMM 2.38.0, we have laid a solid and modernized enterprise-grade foundation for PMM. We have migrated our base operating system on which we build our base image from Enterprise Linux 7 ( CentOS 7) to Enterprise Linux 9 (EL9). Thus starting with PMM 2.38.0, we have made PMM publicly available on EL9 (Oracle Linux 9) as an early preview.

    The benefits of this migration are manifold. The migration fixes a large number of CVEs and improves upstream's response time to security-related issues. You can access more modern libraries to build on long with better compatibility with new technologies. 

    We will be rolling this out in phases. 

    The following users will be able to take advantage of this immediately:

    - Brand new installations of PMM, regardless of how you choose to run it
        * Docker: substitute perconalab/pmm-server:2.37.0-el9 in the docker run commands
        * OVF: [Download](https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/pmm2/2.37.0/ova/pmm-server-2.37.0-el9.ova) it directly from percona.com.
    - Docker/Podman users that do full container replacement upgrades to newer versions of PMM*
        * substitute perconalab/pmm-server:2.37.0-el9 in the docker run commands

    Users who will need to wait a bit longer:

    - AMI users
    - Users that exclusively upgrade through the UI’s “Upgrade Now” button
    - OVF users

- ClickHouse plugin - We have migrated from the  Altinity Clickhouse datasource to the Grafana Clickhouse datasource due to the vulnerabilities discovered. 

    Due to this migration, we have also updated our experimental Environment Overview Dashboard.

    ```txt
    !!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
        Though we have removed the datasource from PMM, we are still reusing the same name (ClickHouse) to keep the changes minimal. Thus, if you are using the old datasource in your dashboards, ensure that you upgrade the underlying queries that will pull the data from the new datasource.
    ```
    **Example**
    
    The following example shows the query after migration:

    ```sh
    // Grafana ClickHouse datasource
    SELECT period_start as t,
    sum(m_query_time_sum)/sum(m_query_time_cnt) as QLatency,
    environment
    FROM pmm."metrics" 
    WHERE $__timeFilter(period_start) AND environment != ''
    GROUP BY t, environment
    ORDER BY t    
    ```
- Grafana - Grafana has been upgraded to 9.2.18 due to [CVE-2023-28119](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mqj-xc49-246p) and [CVE-2023-1387](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c3h9-vpfv-3x4m).

- Exporters - Updated the mysqld_exporter, node_exporter, postgres_exporter, mongo_exporter to fix the CVE's.



### Improved nodes view on the Inventory page

In our continuing endeavor to enhance user experience, we further improved the **Inventory** page by improving the **Nodes** tab. With this change, you can get more context on your inventory objects, such as node, and more actionable information for exploring and resolving possible issues.

Here is the change as part of PMM 2.38.0:

- You can now see the number of agents running on any particular node. When you click on any node, the UI navigates to the view of agents, which is filtered to display only agents related to that specific node. 

To see the details of the agents running, do the following:

On the **Nodes** tab, under the **Monitoring** column, click **OK** or **Failed** depending on the status of the node that you have selected. A page that provides the user with crucial information regarding the total number of agents deployed on that node is displayed.

- You can also view comprehensive information about each agent, including key attributes such as node type, IP address, and associated services. This gives you a complete overview of the nodes at a glance.

- You can check the health status of the agents to see if they are running or have failed.

### Backup enhancements

#### Better folder management for enhanced PMB compatibility 
We’ve added a new **Folder** field to the Create Backup pages. Use this to set a specific target directory within the selected local or S3-compatible location for the backup.  

Organizing backups in folders makes grouping PBM backups for clusters easier, and it improves PMM-PBM (Percona Backup for MongoDB) integration workflows. 

The **Folder** field is automatically populated with the value of the cluster label. You can change this default folder from PMM’s Advanced Sett`ings, but make sure you understand how your custom folder will impact PBM integration workflows.


#### Sharded cluster MongoDB backup support 
This release introduces support for working with backups for sharded clusters. PMM handles the backup process end-to-end, but restoring such artifacts is currently possible only via the CLI, using Percona Backup for MongoDB.

For information on restoring sharded backups, check the [PBM documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/usage/restore.html)
