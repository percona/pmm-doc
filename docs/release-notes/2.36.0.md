## Release Highlights

<!---

### pg_stat_monitor 2.0 support in QAN

We are excited to announce that PMM V2.36 now supports [pg_stat_monitor](https://docs.percona.com/pg-stat-monitor/index.html) 2.0 (PGSM 2.0) in QAN, a powerful Query Performance Monitoring tool for PostgreSQL. With this update, you can experience the latest improvements and fixes covered by PGSM2:
- Its improved internal architecture leads to fewer lock acquisitions, and therefore an improved performance by approximately 20% when tested using pgbench.
- Support for PostgreSQL 15 
- Improved consistency with pg_stat_statements - Now pg_stat_monitor view has exactly the same column names, columns and data types as the pg_stat_statements view for every major version of PostgreSQL from 11 to 15.
- An indication of buckets as "done" vs "current" eliminates the need for the tool to evaluate the bucket status and facilitates the accurate data display
- The generation of a unique ID of a query, independent from PostgreSQL versions, database, users or schemas, improves observability of query planning, execution and performance

For more information on the enhancements included in PGSM2, please refer to the [full list] (https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md)available.

### Experimental Kubernetes Dashboards

We are thrilled to introduce three new dashboards in PMM V2.36, located in the Experimental folder of the Dashboards section. These dashboards, named Kubernetes Cluster Summary, Kubernetes Pods Status, and Kubernetes Volumes, provide valuable insights into Kubernetes environments. We encourage you to test these experimental dashboards and share your feedback with us on the forum, helping us improve them for future releases.

Add more subsections for more release highlights.

## New Features

[PMM-9474](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9474) - Execution of PostgreSQL checks against all DB's

[PMM-11363](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11363) - Starting with PMM 2.36.0, you no longer need to unassign a role before deleting it. If you try to delete a role assigned to a user, you will see a dropdown with replacement roles. As a result, the selected role will be assigned to the user.
## Improvements

- [PMM-11182](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11182) - Renamed the **Disconnect** button on the confirmation message that pop-ups when you are terminating Percona Platform connections as an Administrator. The button is now called **Force disconnect**, to better differentiate between situations where you are disconnecting using a Percona Platform Account.

  Force-disconnecting only clears the connection from PMM, without automatically removing the disconnected servers from Percona Platform as well. We recommend that you always disconnect while logged in with your Percona Account. Otherwise, make sure to manually remove the forced-disconnected servers from your [list of PMM instances in Percona Platform](https://portal.percona.com/pmm-instances).

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-8146](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8146) - DBaaS: Fixed an issue where a user could still see Services, agents, and nodes related to the DB cluster already deleted in DBaaS.
- [PMM-8251](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8251) - DBaaS: Although the cluster was forcefully unregistered from DBaaS, the metrics were still collected. After unregistering K8s, the metrics should not be collected. This issue has been resolved now.
- [PMM-10254](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10254) - Dashboards: On the MySQL/Mongo dashboards, the Memory Available graph showed incorrect values. The issue has been resolved now.

- [PMM-11209](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11209) - [Backup Management] Improved error handing for partially successful restores. Restore jobs that finished successfully on some nodes and failed on others are no longer locked in a **Pending** state. Instead, PMM now shows a **PartlyDone** error and populates the logs with specific details on the restore status for the replica set and nodesup restores.
