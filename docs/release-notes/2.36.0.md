## New Features

[PMM-9474](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9474) - Execution of PostgreSQL checks against all DB's

[PMM-11363](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11363) - Starting with PMM 2.36.0, to delete a role, you do not need to unassign a role before deleting it. When you delete a role assigned to a user, a dropdown with replacement roles is shown. Thus, the selected role will be assigned instead of the deleted role.

## Improvements

- [PMM-11182](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11182) - Renamed the **Disconnect** button on the confirmation message that pop-ups when you are terminating Percona Platform connections as an Administrator. The button is now called **Force disconnect**, to better differentiate between situations where you are disconnecting using a Percona Platform Account.

  Force-disconnecting only clears the connection from PMM, without automatically removing the disconnected servers from Percona Platform as well. We recommend that you always disconnect while logged in with your Percona Account. Otherwise, make sure to manually remove the forced-disconnected servers from your [list of PMM instances in Percona Platform](https://portal.percona.com/pmm-instances).

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-8146](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8146) - DBaaS: Fixed an issue where a user could still see Services, agents, and nodes related to the DB cluster already deleted in DBaaS.
- [PMM-8251](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8251) - DBaaS: Although the cluster was forcefully unregistered from DBaaS, the metrics were still collected. After unregistering K8s, the metrics should not be collected. This issue has been resolved now.
- [PMM-10254](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10254) - Dashboards: On the MySQL/Mongo dashboards, the Memory Available graph showed incorrect values. The issue has been resolved now.
- [PMM-10606](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10606) - Fixed an issue for the incorrect link for node name on the mysql instance summary dashboard.
- [PMM-11001](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11001) - Fixed an error that occurred in certain scenarios when expanding alert rules nested in folders.
- [PMM-11209](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11209) - [Backup Management] Improved error handing for partially successful restores. Restore jobs that finished successfully on some nodes and failed on others are no longer locked in a **Pending** state. Instead, PMM now shows a **PartlyDone** error and populates the logs with specific details on the restore status for the replica set and nodesup restores.
