Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them, and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Support for version 8.0 of Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB), MongoDB Community, and MongoDB Enterprise

The latest version of MongoDB, along with the upcoming [PSMDB 8.0](https://www.percona.com/software/mongodb/percona-server-for-mongodb), introduce [numerous improvements and significant performance enhancements](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/8.0/).

We have updated PMM 2 to support these new versions, including changes to `mongodb_exporter` to accommodate the revised metrics structure (e.g., `wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions` is now `queues.execution`).

The MongoDB **Oplog Details** dashboard is also adapted to support MongoDB 8.0's new oplog metrics, with updated panels for **Oplog Buffered Operations** and **Buffer Capacity**.

    - This enhancement requires PMM Agent version 2.43.1 or later.

    - MongoDB 8.0 introduces significant changes to its internal metrics structure. While we have updated PMMâ€™s built-in dashboards to reflect these changes, you may need to update any custom dashboards to align with the new metrics.

## Improved PostgreSQL 17 metrics collection

PMM 2.44.0 strengthens monitoring capabilities for PostgreSQL 17, building on the recent support for Query Analytics introduced in PMM 2.43.2.
With this update, we've revised queries tailored to PostgreSQL 17's updated schema to ensure that metrics are accurately collected and displayed in the **PostgreSQL Overview** dashboard.

Columns like `checkpoints_timed` in the `stat_bgwriter` collector are now also correctly recognized.

## Fixed metrics collection for MongoDB backups

We've resolved an issue where Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) metrics were not being scraped by default and required the `--enable-all-collectors` flag.

With this fix, PBM metrics are now automatically collected when MongoDB services are added to PMM, without requiring additional configuration.

However, PBM metrics collection is disabled for PMM Clients 2.43.0 and 2.43.1 due to a memory leak identified in these versions. This functionality is supported starting with PMM Client 2.43.2 and later.
