Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

* **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL monitoring**

    AWS monitoring in PMM now covers PostgreSQL RDS and PostgreSQL Aurora types. PMM will include them in [Discovery UI](../setting-up/client/aws.md#adding-an-amazon-rds-postgresql-instance) and if added after discovery there will be some node related metrics for PostgreSQL databases. Before this release, this was available only to MySQL-related instances from Amazon RDS.

* **Support for pg_stat_monitor 0.8**

    Added compatibility with [pg_stat_monitor plugin v 0.8.0](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/releases/tag/REL0_8_0_STABLE ). This is not exposing the new features for the plugin in PMM, but just makes Query Analytics metrics collected on the same level it was with version 0.6.0 of the plugin.

* **Consistent support of Technical Preview Features

    Reworked the PMM Settings page to provide an easy-to-use way for people to understand and manage the ability to activate or deactivate technical preview features. We also provide a better definition of what a [Technical Preview](../details/glossary.md#technical-preview) is.

* **Make non-dashboard pages part of grafana fork codebase (migration)

* **Security Threat Tool Scheduling - Manage execution and execution intervals**

    Security Threat Tool users are now able to control the Security Check execution time intervals for groups of checks and move some checks between groups, and disable some checks if necessary.

* **Azure Discovery and Node metrics extraction**

    **Technical Preview**: PMM will provide the ability to have the same level of support for Azure DB as we have for AWS RDS. You will be available to discover and easily add Azure databases for monitoring by PMM. This feature is available only if you explicitly turn it ON on the Setting page. Turning this feature OFF will not remove added Services from monitoring, it will just hide the ability to Discover and add new Microsoft Azure Services.

*   **[DBaaS] Resource planning and prediction (Resource calculator)**

    **Technical preview**: While creating a DB cluster a user can see a prediction of the resources this cluster will consume with all components as well as the current total and available resources in the K8s. Users will be warned that if they attempt to create a DB cluster it may be unsuccessful because of available resources in the K8s.

*   **[DBaaS] PSMDB 1.7.0 operator support **
