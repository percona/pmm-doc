Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- **Option to disconnect PMM instances from Percona Platform**. 
Following the recently introduced support for connecting PMM to Percona Platform, you now also have the option to unlink any servers that are no longer relevant to your Platform organization. To disconnect a PMM server, go to <i class="uil uil-cog"></i> **Configuration > Settings > Percona Platform** and click **Disconnect**. 

  You can check the list of servers connected to an organization in Percona Platform by clicking **View instances** on the **Dashboard** page.

- **Test SMTP settings to validate your Email alerting configuration**. When configuring an SMTP email server for sending out email notifications, you now have the option to test that your specified settings are correct. 

  The **Email** tab under <i class="uil uil-cog"></i> **Configuration > Settings > Communication** now includes a **Test** button to send a test alert through the specified server.
