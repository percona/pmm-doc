Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights
- **Experimental Dashboards**

We have added a new process of shipping dashboards to the PMM users. Henceforth, we will upload a new dashboard (that is not yet official) to the Experimental folder to allow the users to test them in their environment and provide feedback in [Percona Community Forum](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/30/none).

We are shipping the K8s monitoring dashboard (LINK) as part of our DBaaS feature and Environment Overview dashboard (LINK) in this release.
