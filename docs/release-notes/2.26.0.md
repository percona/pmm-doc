Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- **Experimental Dashboards**

New experimental dashboards are introduced that will be shipped to the PMM users. These dashboards will be uploaded to the Experimental folder to enable the users to test them in their environment and provide feedback.
 
 The following Dashboards are being shipped as part of this release:

 - Dbaas: [K8s monitoring dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-cluster-summary.md)

 - [Environment Overview dashboard](../dashboards/dashboard-env-overview.md)

 - [Environment Summary dashboard](ashboard-environent-summary)

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    These experimental dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.   


- **SMTP Configuration Verification**

You can now verify the SMTP configuration for email (as a notification channel) when using the alerting feature in PMM. This enables you to know upfront if there is any problem with the SMTP configuration (without checking the logs).
