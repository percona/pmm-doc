## Release Highlights

### MongoDB backups: UI-based restore on a new replica set cluster

Building on the recent MongoDB backup management enhancements, we have now added the option to restore backups on different clusters with the same configuration. This enables you to test restore data before deploying it on Dev environments. 
Restoring on different clusters is not available for sharded clusters. This is a complicated process that still requires manual intervention. For more information, see [Restoring from a sharded cluster]()

### Query Analytics - Meta information

QAN is an important tool that can help filter data and identify problematic queries. However, it can be challenging to determine which services, nodes, and other labels are linked to these queries. PMM 2.39.0 now includes a metadata table for QAN to address this issue. This table contains information such as Node name, Node name, Service name, Service type, and user name for each selected query. With this feature, you can easily identify the services, nodes, and labels associated with your identified queries.

To view the metadata table, navigate to the **Main** menu and click on **Query Analytics (QAN)**. This will bring you to the **Query Analytics** page. Next, select the desired query and expand the **Metadata** tab. The metadata for that specific query will then be displayed.

## Known issues

**PMM does not allow to install, update or remove plugins**

[PMM-12231](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-12231) - In the recent versions of PMM, users have encountered issues with installing, updating and removing plugins from PMM. The cause of this issue is the incorrect permissions assigned to the `/srv/grafana/plugins` directory. These permissions are preventing the grafana component from accessing the directory.

**Solution**

Set the user ownership on the directory`/srv/grafana/plugins` to `grafana:grafana`.
