Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations—regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

PMM version 3.x marks a new milestone for PMM, now built on a more secure foundation, with an enhanced user experience and easier deployment across a broader range of environments.

## Improved security

### Enhanced API authentication with Grafana service accounts

With the release of PMM 3.x, we've made a significant enhancement to the way API authentication is handled. PMM no longer relies on API keys as the primary method for controlling access to the PMM Server components and resources. Instead, PMM now leverages Grafana service accounts, which provide a more secure and manageable authentication mechanism compared to API keys.

The transition to service accounts brings the following advantages:

- Fine-grained access control, ensuring that each account gets access only to the necessary resources.
- Logging of all actions performed, providing better visibility and auditing.

When you install PMM 3.x, any existing API keys will be seamlessly converted to service accounts with corresponding service tokens. For more information about using service accounts in PMM, see [Service account authentication](../api/authentication.md).

### More options for deploying PMM rootless

In addition to Podman, PMM Server can also now be deployed rootless with Helm, Docker, Virtual Appliance, or Amazon AWS.

This setup prioritizes security by eliminating the need for root privileges to create, run, and manage containers. Running PMM Server as a non-root user means that you never have to give a user root permission on the host. This adds an extra layer of security, essential for protecting against potential security breaches.

For detailed instructions on deploying rootless PMM, check the [Setting up PMM Server](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/index.html#set-up-pmm-server) topic.

### Oracle Enterprise Linux 9 images only

With Enterprise Linux 7 (EL7) approaching its end-of-life date, we've made sure that PMM 3 exclusively uses Oracle Enterprise Linux 9 (EL9) as the base system for all PMM images.

We began this transition from CentOS 7 to EL9 with the latest PMM 2 releases, and now with PMM 3, we are no longer building Docker containers, AMIs, or OVFs based on EL7.

By moving to EL9, we ensure that PMM is built on more modern libraries and stays compatible with new technologies. Moreover, EL9 grants access to faster upstream responses to issues, particularly those concerning security, so that your PMM setup remains up-to-date and secure.

Due to this change, PMM 3 cannot be started on host servers running EL7.

### Enhanced PMM deployment on AMI and OVF environments

PMM is now deployed inside containers within AMI and OVF instances. These containers are managed via Podman and operate in rootless mode, which means they do not require root privileges to run. This approach significantly increases security and ensures a consistent and unified experience across different deployment types.

### More stable and quicker upgrades

In PMM 3, we're improving stability and speed of the upgrading process by leveraging using WatchTower, an external tool. When you click "Upgrade Now" on the Home Dashboard, PMM calLs on WatchTower to replace the PMM Docker Server container. WatchTower gracefully shuts down the current container and links the new one to the existing Docker volume, keeping all data and settings intact. This streamlined method enhances testing workflows, fixes upgrade glitches, and ensures a smoother experience for Docker, Podman, and OVF/AMI setups.

WatchTower commands will be integrated into the Easy Install Script only with the beta release. Until then, you can manually test the PMM installation via WatchTower using the  instructions for  [manual installing PMM server with Docker container](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/index.md). 

The PMM Server container introduces two new environment variables:

PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST=${PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST:-http://watchtower:8080}
PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN=${PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN:-123}
PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST connects to the WatchTower container and includes the schema, host, and port. PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN should match WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN in the WatchTower container.

The upgrade involves setting up two containers: the PMM Server container and the WatchTower container, which runs alongside it. While only the PMM Server container is exposed to the external network for user connection, WatchTower operates solely within the PMM Server container's environment, requiring access to the Docker socket to interact with Docker.


In PMM 3, we're enhancing upgrade processes for better stability and speed. We're introducing WatchTower, an external upgrade tool, which replaces the internal RPM packages mechanism. When you click "Upgrade Now" on the Home Dashboard, WatchTower pulls the new base image, gracefully shuts down your running container, and restarts it with the new image. This streamlined approach improves testing workflows, resolves upgrade issues, and simplifies Docker container upgrades. This applies to Docker, Podman, and OVF/AMI deployments.

The upgrade involves two containers:

- PMM Server
- WatchTower, running alongside the PMM Server container.
Only the PMM Server container is exposed externally, while WatchTower is accessible only by the PMM Server container. WatchTower requires access to the Docker socket to send requests to Docker.


Starting with PMM 3 beta, WatchTower commands will be included in the Easy Install Script. Until then, you can manually test PMM installation via WatchTower. For instructions, refer to the Install PMM server with Docker container documentation.





The Watctower commands will be included Easy Install Script starting with PMM 3 beta. Until then, you can test the PMM installation via WatchWower by running WatchTower manually. 
For information on how to do this, check out the [Install PMM server with Docker container]

Requirements:
- Watchtower and PMM Server should run on the same network or at least PMM should be able to connect watchtower
- Watchtower shouldn’t be available anywhere outside of docker network or localhost

PMM Server container has 2 new environment variables



PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST=${PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST:-http://watchtower:8080}
PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN=${PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN:-123}
PMM_WATCHTOWER_HOST is used to connect to watchtower container and should include schema, host and port as in example above

PMM_WATCHTOWER_TOKEN should be the same as WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN in watchtower container
It's a bit unsecure?



## Finalized DBaaS migration to Percona Everest

In previous PMM releases, the Database as a Service (DBaaS) functionality has been gradually transferred to Percona Everest, a standalone product, dedicated to streamlined database deployment and management.
While PMM 2.x versions continue to support existing DBaaS functionality, PMM 3 marks the complete migration, removing all references to DBaaS.

If you are an existing PMM user who relies on DBaaS functionality, we encourage you to explore [Percona Everest](https://www.percona.com/resources/percona-everest) and leverage its advanced features for database deployment. Percona Everest also integrates with PMM to provide monitoring capabilities for your database infrastructure. To learn more about integrating Percona Everest with PMM and adding monitoring endpoints, see [Add monitoring endpoints in the Everest documentation](https://docs.percona.com/everest/use/monitor_endpoints.html).

## Improved UX with Grafana latest release

PMM now integrates Grafana 10.4, which delivers the following important enhancements alongside all the advancements introduced since the previous Grafana 9.2.20 integration. For the full list of changes included in this update, see [Grafana's 10.4 release blog](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/03/06/grafana-10.4-release-all-the-latest-features/).

### Improved navigation

With the 10.4 update, PMM now includes a revamped header with search, breadcrumbs, and a reorganized menu that groups related tools together, making it easier to navigate PMM's features and find what you need:
