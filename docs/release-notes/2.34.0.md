| **Installation:** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/pmm/quickstart) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.



## Release Highlights

### Various UX enhancements to Backup Management

 With this release, we are updating the Backup and Restore functionality with key usability enhancements, including:

- Filtering on services at backup creation time. This makes it considerably easier to find the right service for a backup when working with multiple servers.
- Automatic redirection to the **Restores** page after initiating a restore. From here you can immediately monitor the restore process, and see the restore history for your PMM instance.
- Added information about the type of storage for the backup artifacts on the  **All backups** page. This helps you get a more comprehensive overview of your current backups.
- Design and usability improvements on the **Create Backup** and **All Backups** page to increase consistency with other PMM UI controls.


### DBaaS migration

Starting with PMM 2.34.0, PMM installs and manages operators using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and database clusters using dbaas-operator. Nonetheless, these changes are backward incompatible, and you must perform these additional steps:

1. Unregister the Kubernetes cluster from PMM and register it back. PMM will install OLM and dbaas-catalog to manage the lifecycle of PXC, PSMDB, and DBaaS operators.
2. Create a database cluster for each database cluster you have created in PMM. You can use the [script]() to do it automatically.

For more information, see the [architecture]() of DBaaS.

### New components

VMProxy version 2.34.0 has been introduced as part of PMM 2.34.0.

## New Features

[PMM-11031](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11031) - To enhance the DBaas experience, the UI has been extended to include the following:

    - Network and Security - DBaaS users can set a source range from which they can connect to their DB clusters with the **Expose** field. You can modify the exposure level using the **Source Range** field. Additionally, the **Source Range** field allows you to choose the network from which you can connect.
    - Configuring the database engine - Copy-paste the config string into the **Configuration** text box to configure the database engine.
    - Configuring storage classes - You can choose from the available classes.


## Improvements

- [PMM-11024](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11024) - [DBaaS]: Move from dbaas-controller to dbaas-operator
- [PMM-10873](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10873) - [DBaaS]: Create DB Cluster: We have modified the UI to include a separate window rather than a popup so that creating a DB cluster is easier.
- [PMM-11132](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11132) - [DBaaS]: During K8s cluster registration, a new state called "Provisioning" is added. Provisioning is the default state, and once that is completed, the state will change to Active.
- [PMM-11134](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11134) - [DBaaS]: Edit DB Cluster : We have modified the UI to include a separate window rather than a popup so that editing a DB cluster is easier.
- [PMM-9262 ](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9262)  - [Backups]: After starting a backup restore from the **All Backups** page, PMM now automatically redirects you to the **Restores** tab, where you can check the status of your new restore.
- [PMM-11086](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11086) - [Backups]: Improved design for the **On Demand** and **Schedule Backup** cards on the **Create Backup** page.

- [PMM-10924](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10924) - [Backups]: The **Location** column on the **All Backups** page has been enhanced to include information about the storage type used for the backup: Local or S3-compatible.
- [PMM-11171](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11171) - [Backups]: The **Service name** field on the Create Backup page is now searchable. This makes it easier to find the right service for a new backup when working with multiple servers. Just paste the name of the server you're looking for, or start typing to see the list of matching servers.
- [PMM-9079](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9079)   - [Backups]: Added **Target Service** column under **Backup > Restores** to show the service to which a backup was restored.

- [PMM-11189](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11189) - Starting With PMM 2.34.0, we have implemented vmproxy integration and frontend API changes.
- [PMM-10705](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10705) - As of PMM 2.34.0, Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) is used for handling the installation and updating of operators for PMM in an effective, automated, and scalable manner.

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-7350](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7350) - [Dbaas]: Fixed an issue where DB Cluster did not restart all PXC servers and proxy SQL servers on restarting.
