Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.



## Release Highlights

### UX enhancements to Backup Management

With this release, we are updating the Backup and Restore functionality with key usability enhancements, including:

- Filtering on services at backup creation time. This makes it considerably easier to find the right service for a backup when working with multiple servers.
- Automatic redirection to the **Restores** page after initiating a restore. From here you can immediately monitor the restore process, and see an overview of all the restore jobs for your PMM instance.
- Added information about the storage type for the backups listed on **All backups** page. This helps you get a more comprehensive overview of your current backups.
- Design and usability improvements on the **Create Backup** and **All Backups** page to increase consistency with other PMM UI controls.

### Components Upgrade
- List the components which are upgraded as part of the Release.

## New Features
  
- [PMM-11031](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11031) - To enhance the DBaas experience, the UI has been extended to include the following:
  - Network and Security - DBaaS users can set a source range from which they can connect to their DB clusters with the **Expose** filed. You can modify the exposure level using the **Source Range** field. Additionally, the **Source Range** field allows you to choose the network from which you can connect.
  - Configuring the database engine - Copy-paste the config string into the **Configuration** text box to configure the database engine.
  - Configuring storage classes - You can choose from the available classes.

- [PMM-11086](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11086) - Improved design for the **On Demand** and **Schedule Backup** cards on the **Create Backup** page. In addition, the **Created** column on the **Restores** tab has been replaced with **Started at** and **Ended** columns, to provide more insight into the restore process.
