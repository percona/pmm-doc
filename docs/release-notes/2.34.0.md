## Release Highlights

### Various UX enhancements to Backup Management

With this release, we are updating the Backup and Restore functionality with key usability enhancements, including:

- Filtering on services at backup creation time. This makes it considerably easier to find the right service for a backup when working with multiple servers.
- Automatic redirection to the **Restores** page after initiating a restore. From here you can immediately monitor the restore process, and see the restore history for your PMM instance.
- Added information about the type of storage for the backup artifacts on the  **All backups** page. This helps you get a more comprehensive overview of your current backups.
- Design and usability improvements on the **Create Backup** and **All Backups** page to increase consistency with other PMM UI controls.

### Components Upgrade

- List the components which are upgraded as part of the Release.

## New Features

- [PMM-3996](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-3996) - Starting with PMM 2.34.0, pmm-admin connects to pmm-agent over UNIX sockets by default. As a result, pmm-admin gives you fine-grained control over pmm-agent. You can define which users can use pmm-admin to access pmm-agent to mitigate security concerns.

- [PMM-11031](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11031) - user are able to "expose" cluster and modify exposure level, users can config db engine by copy&paste config string, users can select from available storage classes.

- [PMM-11086](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11086) - Improved design for the **On Demand** and **Schedule Backup** cards on the **Create Backup** page. In addition, the **Created** column on the **Restores** tab has been replaced with **Started at** and **Ended** columns, to provide more insight into the restore process.
