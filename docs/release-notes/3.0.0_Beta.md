| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/pmm/quickstart) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations—regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

### Streamlined update process

We've enhanced PMM's update system with a new **Update** page, accessible via **PMM Configuration > Updates**.  This new intuitive interface replaces the previous RPM-based update method, allowing you to easily track versions, configurations, and the health status of your PMM Server and Clients. 

This change comes with proactive notifications, alerting you immediately when new versions are released, and providing detailed change summaries so you can make informed decisions before upgrading.

#### New upgrade environment variables

When migrating from PMM v2 to PMM v3, you’ll need to update your environment variables to match the new naming convention. This is because PMM v3 introduces several important changes to improve consistency and clarity:

- environment variables now use PMM_ prefix
- some boolean flags reversed (e.g., `DISABLE_` → `ENABLE_`)
- removed deprecated variables

To check the Migration reference table, see [Environment variables in PMM](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/baremetal/docker/env_var.md##variables-for-migrating-from-pmm-v2-to-pmm-v3).

### Encryption of sensitive data

To strengthen the security of your monitoring setup, all sensitive information stored in the PMM Server database, including usernames, passwords, AWS keys, Azure credentials, and TLS/SSL certificates, is now encrypted.

By default, an encryption key is automatically generated and stored at `/srv/pmm-encryption.key`. You also have the option to specify a custom path for the encryption key using the new environment variable `PMM_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH`.

When upgrading to PMM 3, any existing unencrypted PMM 2 data will be encrypted automatically.

### Grafana Angular support discontinuation

Grafana will discontinue support for Angular starting with version 12, expected in 2025. This affects numerous panels and plugins, including but not limited to Graph and Table panels. 

We have already migrated many plugins to newer technologies and are actively working on the remaining components to ensure continued functionality. We recommend that you review all plugins in your dashboards and begin planning transitions to newer panel types where necessary.

For a comprehensive list of affected plugins and guidance on migration, see [Grafana's official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/angular_deprecation/angular-plugins/) on Angular deprecation and plugin migration.

We will provide regular updates on our migration progress in future releases to help you prepare for this change and modernize your dashboards.

## New default password for AWS Marketplace instances

PMM Server instances launched via AWS Marketplace now use the EC2 instance ID as the default password for the '*admin*' user.

This change stems from our recent transition to Docker-based deployment, ensuring secure and consistent initial access across all new AWS Marketplace instances.

Only new PMM instances launched via AWS Marketplace are affected by this update. For existing instances, continue to use 'admin' as the default password.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to change the default password immediately after first login.

For more information, see [Install PMM Server on AWS Marketplace](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/aws/aws.md)

### Breaking API changes

This release introduces major breaking API changes:

- Database record identifiers no longer use prefixes (e.g., `/agent_id/`) and are now represented as plain UUIDs
- Feature toggles have been simplified from dual booleans to a single boolean control with an `enable_feature` property  
- API responses now consistently emit all fields including those with default or zero values
- Service, node, and agent management has been streamlined through consolidated endpoints where the resource type is specified as a top-level property in the request payload
- Low-level Inventory API sections have been removed from documentation in favor of the Management API for inventory-related tasks.

For detailed information about all these API changes and new endpoints, see the [Release Notes in the PMM API Documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/v3/reference/release-notes/3.0.0_Beta).
