Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights


## Ubuntu 24.04  Noble support

PMM now officially supports monitoring of databases running on the recently released Ubuntu 24.04 Noble operating system.

With this addition, PMM continues to provide comprehensive coverage across a wide range of Linux distributions commonly used in database deployments. For more information, see [blogpost]().


## Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring and management/ Configurable metrics resolutions per exporter/Configurable metrics resolutions per exporter:

Enhanced control over per-instance connections in actions/jobs runner

PMM now offers a range of improvements specifically tailored for PostgreSQL users. 

This option runner includes a configurable limit on the number of connections to the same instance, preventing excessive connections during concurrent operations. Metrics resolutions (LR/MR/HR) can now be configured on a per-service basis, giving users fine-grained control over the metrics collection cycle for each exporter. 

The "Configure PostgreSQL Service" page in the web interface introduces an option to set and configure the maximum connection limit, allowing users to control the upper limit of connections to their PostgreSQL instances directly from the web UI. Furthermore, PMM supports per-database metrics collection and control of parameters for PostgreSQL instances, enabling users to gather granular data specific to individual databases and optimize their monitoring setup without overusing connections. These enhancements provide PostgreSQL users with greater flexibility, control, and insights into the performance and health of their databases, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their monitoring and management strategies.



- PostgreSQL allows per-database metrics collection and control of parameters, enabling more granular data gathering without overusing connections. (https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12896, https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12895, https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12971)

PMM now provides a configurable limit on the number of connections to the same instance in the actions/jobs runner.
This improvement helps optimize resource usage and prevents excessive connections during concurrent operations like running multiple Explains or Indexes simultaneously.
Users can fine-tune the connection limit based on their specific requirements and environment.


Configurable metrics resolutions per exporter:

PMM introduces the ability to configure metrics resolutions (LR/MR/HR) on a per-service basis.
This enhancement gives users fine-grained control over the metrics collection cycle for each exporter.
By customizing the resolution settings for individual services, users can optimize the balance between granularity and resource consumption based on their monitoring needs.


Max connection limit configuration for PostgreSQL service:

The "Configure PostgreSQL Service" page in the PMM web interface now includes an option to set and configure the maximum connection limit.
This feature, previously available through the CLI, allows users to control the upper limit of connections to their PostgreSQL instances directly from the web UI.
By setting an appropriate max connection limit, users can ensure optimal performance and resource utilization for their PostgreSQL databases.


Granular metrics collection and parameter control for PostgreSQL:

PMM now supports per-database metrics collection and control of parameters for PostgreSQL instances.
This improvement enables users to gather more granular data specific to individual databases within a PostgreSQL instance.
By controlling parameters at the database level, users can fine-tune the monitoring and management of their PostgreSQL environments without overusing connections.
This feature empowers users to optimize their PostgreSQL monitoring setup and gain deeper insights into the performance and health of individual databases.



These enhancements collectively strengthen PMM's capabilities in terms of connection management, granular control, and customization options, enabling users to tailor their monitoring and management setup to their specific needs and optimize resource utilization across their database infrastructure.
Please note that you should replace "Version X.X.X" with the actual version number of the PMM release that includes these improvements. CopyRetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Send Message 3 Op
