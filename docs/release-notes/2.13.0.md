[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x)
is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL
performance.

## Release Highlights

1. Integrated Alerting MVP  (Technical Preview)

    A new feature in PMM to set up parameters and revive alerts about the Services and Nodes monitored by PMM.

    Read more [on our blog](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/18/percona-monitoring-and-management-introduces-integrated-alerting-in-v2-13-via-a-technical-preview/) and in our [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/using/alerting.html).

    > Note: This capability is being released as a **Technical Preview**. We do not recommend the use of Integrated Alerting in enterprise or production environments until the functionality is released as general availability (GA). While in Technical Preview status, the feature is not supported by Percona Support SLA (but is supported by Product/Engineering on a best-effort basis).

2. [Ability to monitor SSL-enabled MongoDB](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5364)

    Allows PMM administrators to set up configured SSL certificate “keys” to authenticate the connection to PMM, specifically for setting up MongoDB. This is a critical security requirement especially in large enterprise infrastructure environments.

3. [Node Summary/Nodes Overview dashboards: Show External services on dashboards](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6713) (Technical Preview)

    Improves the user experience for adding and viewing external services on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM. External services means any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus export, for example, non-Percona supported databases like Reddis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization’s external application.

4. DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical Preview). We are also releasing the first preview of DBaaS functionality. You can read more about [configuration](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/dbaas.html) and [usage](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/using/platform/dbaas.html).
