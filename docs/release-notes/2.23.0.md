Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- **Grafana Upgrade.** We upgraded the Grafana version used inside PMM from 7.5.7 to 7.5.11 to improve some Grafana instrumentation metrics. Also, the update is delivering a security fix found and fixed in Grafana. We recommend you upgrade to the latest version of PMM asap. Read more about CVE issue https://grafana.com/blog/2021/10/05/grafana-7.5.11-and-8.1.6-released-with-critical-security-fix/) 


- **Backup Management (Technical preview):** 
  - An ability to view logs of the backup process for better visibility over the backup process 
  -  An ability to schedule Point-In-Time-Recovery backup from MongoDB clusters. So the backups are configured correctly. Note: there is no UI  to restore PITR for MongoDB at the moment. It will come with future releases, but it will be possible to restore PITR with Percona Backup for MongoDB (https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/point-in-time-recovery.html)

- **DBaaS (Technical preview):**  From this release, PMM users who are using the DBaaS feature will be able to update versions of Databases they are using in DBaaS manually according to DB's compatibility matrix. 
Please note that we recently found a bug [PMM-8723](#bugs-fixed) that was causing significant problems with DBaaS usage. This bug was fixed in this release, and no additional actions will be required.
