# Get started with PMM

To get up and running with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) in no time, install PMM on Bare Metal/Virtual using the Easy-install script for Docker.

This is a simple and efficient way to install PMM.

??? info "Alternative installation options"
     For alternative setups, explore the additional installation options detailed in the **Setting up** chapter:

    - [Deploy on Podman](../setting-up/server/podman.md)
    - [Deploy based on a Docker image](../setting-up/server/docker.md)
    - [Deploy on Virtual Appliance](../setting-up/server/virtual-appliance.md)
    - [Deploy on Kubernetes via Helm](../setting-up/server/helm.md)
    - [Run a PMM instance hosted at AWS Marketplace](../setting-up/server/aws.md)

#### Prerequisites

Before you start installing PMM, verify that your system meets the compatibility requirements.

??? info "Verify system compatibility"
    - **Disk**: Approximately 1 GB of storage per monitored database node with data retention set to one week. By default, retention is 30 days.
    - **Memory**: A minimum of 2 GB per monitored database node. The increase in memory usage is not proportional to the number of nodes. For example, the data from 20 nodes should be easily handled with 16 GB.
    - **Ports**: Your systemâ€™s firewall should allow TCP traffic on port 443.

## Install PMM

The Easy-install script only runs on Linux-compatible systems. To use it, run the command with `sudo` privileges or as `root`:
{ .power-number }

1. Download and install PMM using `cURL` or `wget`:

    === "cURL"

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://www.percona.com/get/pmm | /bin/bash
        ```

    === "wget"

        ```sh
        wget -qO - https://www.percona.com/get/pmm | /bin/bash    
        ```

2. After the installation is complete, log into PMM with the default `admin:admin` credentials.

??? info "What's happening under the hood?"
     This script does the following:

     * Installs Docker if it is not installed on your system.
     * Stops and renames any currently running PMM Docker container from `pmm-server` to `pmm-server-{timestamp}`. This old `pmm-server container is not a recoverable backup.
     * Pulls and runs the latest PMM Docker image.

### Connect database

Once PMM is set up, choose the database that you want it to monitor:

=== "MySQL"

    To connect a Self-hosted MySQL database:
    { .power-number}

    1. Create database account for PMM using the following command example. This creates a database user with name `pmm``, password `pass``, and the necessary permissions:

        ```sql
        CREATE USER 'pmm'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
        GRANT SELECT, PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, RELOAD, BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'pmm'@'127.0.0.1';
        ```

    2. To optimize server-side resources, install PMM Client via Package Manager on the database node:
         
        1. Install Percona Release Tool:

            ```sh
            wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            ```
        2. Install the PMM Client package:
            
            ```sh
            apt update
            apt install -y pmm2-client
            ```

        3. [Register database node with PMM](../setting-up/client/index.html#register):
                
            ```sh
            pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443
            ```

        4. Add the MySQL database using Performance schema:  

            ```sh 
            pmm-admin add mysql --query-source=perfschema --username=pmm --password=pass MYSQL_NODE
            ```
    ??? info "Alternative database connection workflows"
        While the default instructions above focus on connecting a Self-hosted MySQL database, PMM offers the flexibility to connect to various MySQL databases, including [AWS RDS](../setting-up/client/aws.md), [Azure MySQL](../setting-up/client/azure.md) or [Google Cloud MySQL ](../setting-up/client/google.md). 

        The PMM Client installation also comes with options: in addition to the installation via Package Manager described above, you can also install it as a Docker container or as a binary package. Explore [alternative PMM Client installation options](../setting-up/client/index.html#binary-package) for more information.

        Additionally, if direct access to the database node isn't available, opt for the [PMM Client installation via User Interface](../setting-up/client/mysql.html#with-the-user-interface) instead. 

=== "PostgreSQL"

    To connect a PostgreSQL database using the Postgres CLI: 
    { .power-number}

    1. Create a PMM-specific user for monitoring:
        
        ```
        CREATE USER pmm WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<password>';
        ```
     2. To optimize server-side resources, install PMM Client via Package Manager on the database node:
         
        1. Install Percona Release Tool:

            ```sh
            wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            ```
        2. Install the PMM Client package:
            
            ```sh
            apt update
            apt install -y pmm2-client
            ```
        3. Register the server for monitoring:
       
            ```
            sudo pmm-admin add postgresql --username='pmm' --password=<password>
            ```

    For detailed information, see [Adding a PostgreSQL database](../setting-up/client/postgresql.md).

=== "MongoDB"

    To connect a MongoDB database from the MongoDB CLI:
    { .power-number}
    
    1. Create a PMM-specific user for monitoring from the MongoDB Console. 
    
        Use `mongo` and `admin`:
        
        ```
            db.createRole({
        "role":"explainRole",
        "privileges":[
            {
                "resource":{
                    "db":"",
                    "collection":""
                },
                "actions":[
                    "collStats",
                    "dbHash",
                    "dbStats",
                    "find",
                    "listIndexes",
                    "listCollections"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "roles":[]
        })
        ```

        ```
            db.getSiblingDB("admin").createUser({
        "user":"pmm",
        "pwd":"<password>",
        "roles":[
            {
                "role":"explainRole",
                "db":"admin"
            },
            {
                "role":"clusterMonitor",
                "db":"admin"
            },
            {
                "role":"read",
                "db":"local"
            }
        ]
        })
        exit
        ```
     2. To optimize server-side resources, install PMM Client via Package Manager on the database node:
         
        1. Install Percona Release Tool:

            ```sh
            wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            ```
        2. Install the PMM Client package:
            
            ```sh
            apt update
            apt install -y pmm2-client
            ```

        3. Register the server for monitoring:

            ```
            sudo pmm-admin add mongodb --username=pmm --password=<password>
            ```
   
    For detailed information on adding a MongoDB database, see [Adding a MongoDB database for monitoring](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/client/mongodb.html).

=== "ProxySQL"
    To enable ProxySQL performance metrics monitoring:
     { .power-number}

    1. Configure a read-only account for monitoring using the [`admin-stats_credentials`](https://proxysql.com/documentation/global-variables/admin-variables/#admin-stats_credentials) variable in ProxySQL.
    2. To optimize server-side resources, install PMM Client via Package Manager on the database node:
         
        1. Install Percona Release Tool:

            ```sh
            wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            ```
        2. Install the PMM Client package:
            
            ```sh
            apt update
            apt install -y pmm2-client
            ```

        3. Register the server for monitoring:

            ```
            sudo pmm-admin add mongodb --username=pmm --password=<password>
            ```
    
    2. Run the following command, keeping in mind that:

        - `username` and `password` are credentials for the administration interface of the monitored ProxySQL.
        -  two positional arguments can be appended to the command line flags: a service name to be used by PMM, and a service address. If not specified, they are substituted automatically as `<node>-proxysql` and `127.0.0.1:6032`.
        - `--service-name`, and `--host` are the hostname or IP address of the service, `--port` is the port number of the service and `--socket` is the UNIX socket path.
        - when both flag and positional argument are present, flag gains higher priority. 

        ```sh
        pmm-admin add proxysql --username=pmm --password=pmm --service-name=my-new-proxysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=6032
        pmm-admin add proxysql --username=pmm --password=pmm --service-name=my-new-proxysql --socket=/tmp/proxysql_admin.sock
        ``` 
    For more information, see [Enable ProxySQL performance metrics monitoring](../setting-up/client/proxysql.md).

=== "HAProxy"
    To add HAProxy services:
    { .power-number}

    1. Configure an haproxy instance:
    { .power-number} 
         1. See [How to configure HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-exposes-a-prometheus-metrics-endpoint).
         2. After HAProxy is running (default address <http://localhost:8404/metrics>) you can add it to PMM.
         3. Use the `haproxy` alias to enable HAProxy metrics monitoring.
    2. To optimize server-side resources, install PMM Client via Package Manager on the database node:
         
        1. Install Percona Release Tool:

            ```sh
            wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            dpkg -i percona-release_latest.generic_all.deb
            ```
        2. Install the PMM Client package:
            
            ```sh
            apt update
            apt install -y pmm2-client
            ```

        3. Register your client node with PMM Server:

            ```sh
            pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443
            ```

            - `X.X.X.X` is the address of your PMM Server.
            - `443` is the default port number.
            - `admin`/`admin` is the default PMM username and password. This is the same account you use to log into the PMM user interface, which you had the option to change when first logging in.
    
    3. Run the following command, where `listen-port` is the port number where HAProxy running. (This is the only required flag.)

        ```sh
        pmm-admin add haproxy --listen-port=8404
        ```

    The output of this command should look as follows:
    
        ```txt
        HAProxy Service added.
        Service ID  : /service_id/c481183f-70a2-443f-91e5-cae5cecd06a2
        Service name: Ubuntu-haproxy
        ```
    For more information on the command arguments, see the [HAProxy topic](../setting-up/client/haproxy.md).

### Check your database

After installing PMM And connecting the database, go to the database's Instance Summary dashboard. This shows essential information about your database performance and an overview of your environment. For more information, see [PMM Dashboards](../details//dashboards/index.md).
