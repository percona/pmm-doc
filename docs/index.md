# Welcome

**Percona Monitoring and Management** (PMM) is a free, open-source monitoring tool for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and ProxySQL, and the servers they run on.

- PMM **collects** from databases and their hosts thousands of out-of-the-box performance **metrics**.

- The PMM [web UI](using/interface.md) **visualizes data** in [dashboards](details/dashboards/).

- Additional features include checking databases for [security threats](using/platform/security-threat-tool.md).

    This is for the latest release, **PMM {{release}}** ([Release Notes](release-notes/{{release}}.md)).

Percona Monitoring and Management helps you improve the performance of databases, simplify their management, and strengthen their security. It is efficient, quick to [set up](setting-up/index.md) and easy to use.

PMM is one [server](details/architecture.md#pmm-server) and as many [clients](details/architecture.md#pmm-client) as there are systems you want to monitor.

- PMM Server receives metrics from PMM Clients and shows them in a web UI.
- PMM Client runs on all systems you want to monitor.

Here's how the web UI home page looks on our <a href='https://pmmdemo.percona.com/' target='_blank'>live demo system</a>. (It's free to use---why not try it?)

PMM can run as a cloud service, on-prem, or across hybrid platforms. It's supported by our [legendary expertise][PERCONA_SERVICES] in open source databases, and by a vibrant developer and user [community][PMM_FORUM].
