# Advisors

Advisors are sets of checks grouped by functionality that run a range of database health checks on a registered instance.

The findings are reported on the **Advisors > Failed Checks** page, and an overview is displayed on the Dashboard in the Failed Advisor Checks panel.

The Advisors option is enabled by default.

Checks are re-fetched and rerun at intervals.

See [Working with Advisor checks](advisors.md).
