# API Keys and authentication

API keys are used to control access to the PMM server components and resources. With an API key, you are authenticated to the PMM server, have access to PMM server components and resources, and perform various actions on them. You can use API keys as a replacement for basic authentication.

##  Generate API keys

PMM uses the Grafana API keys for authentication. Following are the steps to generate the API keys:

1. Login to PMM.
2. From the side menu, click *Configuration  â†’ API keys*.
3. On the Configuration page, click *Add API Key*.
4. *Add API key* dialog box opens.
5. Enter  the following to generate an API key:
    - key name (you can give any desired name)
    - Select the Role from the drop-down 
    - Enter a value in the Time to live text box (hover on the tooltip for more information). 
    - Click Add.

6. *API Key Created* window displays your newly created key. Make sure to copy your key and keep it secure. 

## Authenticate

You can authenticate your request using the HTTPS header.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    Use the `-k` or `--insecure` parameter to force cURL to ignore invalid and self-signed SSL certificate errors. The option will skip the SSL verification process, and you can bypass any SSL errors while still having SSL-encrypted communication. However, using the `--insecure`  parameter is not recommended. Although the data transfer is encrypted, it is not entirely secure. For enhanced security of your PMM installation, you need valid SSL certificates. For information on validating SSL certificates, refer to: [SSL certificates](../how-to/secure.md).

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" https://127.0.0.1/v1/version
```

## Use an API key in basic auth

You can pass the API key into a REST API call as a query parameter in the following format. Replace `API_KEY` with your API key.

**Example**


```sh
curl -X GET https://api_key:API_KEY@localhost/v1/version
```
