    - DBaaS feature is deprecated. We encourage you to use [Percona Everest](https://www.percona.com/blog/announcing-the-alpha-release-of-percona-everest-an-open-source-private-dbaas/) instead. Check our [Migration guide](https://github.com/percona/everest-doc). 
    - DBaaS feature is available for PMM Admin users.


Database as a service (DBaaS) feature of Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source solution to run MySQL and MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes.

It allows you to utilize the benefits of Kubernetes and Percona's operators to run and manage database clusters.
