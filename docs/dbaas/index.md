# Introduction to Database as a service (DBaaS)

Database as a service (DBaaS) feature of Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source solution to run MySQL and MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes.

It allows you to utilize the benefits of Kubernetes and Percona's operators to run and manage database clusters.
