# Roles and permissions in PMM


Roles are the sets of permissions and configurations that determine which metrics a user can access.

Each PMM user is associated with a role that includes permissions. Permissions determine the privileges that a user has in PMM.  For example, the Admin role allows an administrator to create and delete users.

By creating roles, you can specify which data can be queried based on specific label criteria, for instance, allowing the QA team to view data related to test environments.
