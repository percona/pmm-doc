# About Roles and permissions in PMM

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
    PMM Access Control is currently in [technical preview](../details/glossary.md#technical-preview) and is subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.



Roles are the sets of permissions and configurations that determine which metrics a user can access.

Each PMM user is associated with a role that includes permissions. Permissions determine the privileges that a user has in PMM.  For example, the Admin role allows an administrator to create and delete users.

By creating roles, you can specify which data can be queried based on specific label criteria, for instance, allowing the QA team to view data related to test environments.
