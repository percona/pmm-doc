# Required AWS settings

It is possible to use PMM for monitoring Amazon RDS (just like any remote
MySQL instance). In this case, the PMM Client is not installed on the host
where the database server is deployed. By using the PMM web interface, you
connect to the Amazon RDS DB instance. You only need to provide the IAM user
access key (or assign an IAM role) and PMM discovers the Amazon RDS DB
instances available for monitoring.

First of all, ensure that there is the minimal latency between PMM Server and the
Amazon RDS instance.

Network connectivity can become an issue for Prometheus to scrape
metrics with 1 second resolution.  We strongly suggest that you run
PMM Server on AWS (Amazon Web Services) in the same availability zone as
Amazon RDS instances.

It is crucial that *enhanced monitoring* be enabled for the Amazon RDS DB
instances you intend to monitor.

Set the *Enable Enhanced Monitoring* option in the settings of your Amazon RDS DB instance.

## Creating an IAM user with permission to access Amazon RDS DB instances

It is recommended that you use an IAM user account to access Amazon RDS
DB instances instead of using your AWS account. This measure improves security
as the permissions of an IAM user account can be limited so that this account
only grants access to your Amazon RDS DB instances. On the other
hand, you use your AWS account to access all AWS services.

The procedure for creating IAM user accounts is well described in the
Amazon RDS documentation. This section only goes through the essential steps
and points out the steps required for using Amazon RDS with Percona Monitoring and Management.

The first step is to define a policy which will hold all the necessary
permissions. Then, you need to associate this policy with the IAM user or
group. In this section, we will create a new user for this purpose.

## Creating a policy

A policy defines how AWS services can be accessed. Once defined it can be
associated with an existing user or group.

To define a new policy use the IAM page at AWS.

1. Select the *Policies* option on the navigation panel and click the
*Create policy* button.


2. On the *Create policy* page, select the JSON tab and replace the
existing contents with the following JSON document.

```
{ "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{ "Sid": "Stmt1508404837000",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [ "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                              "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                              "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"],
                              "Resource": ["*"] },
                 { "Sid": "Stmt1508410723001",
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Action": [ "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                               "logs:GetLogEvents",
                               "logs:FilterLogEvents" ],
                               "Resource": [ "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:RDSOSMetrics:*" ]}
               ]
}
```


3. Click *Review policy* and set a name to your policy, such as
*AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy*. Then, click the *Create policy* button.

## Creating an IAM user

Policies are attached to existing IAM users or groups. To create a new IAM
user, select *Users* on the Identity and Access Management page at AWS. Then click
*Add user* and complete the following steps:



![image](/_images/aws.iam-users.1.png)


1. On the *Add user* page, set the user name and select the
*Programmatic access* option under
*Select AWS access type*. Set a custom password and then proceed to
permissions by clicking the *Permissions* button.


2. On the *Set permissions* page, add the new user to one or more groups if
necessary. Then, click *Review*.


3. On the *Add user* page, click *Create user*.

## Creating an access key for an IAM user

In order to be able to discover an Amazon RDS DB instance in PMM, you either
need to use the access key and secret access key of an existing IAM user or an
IAM role. To create an access key for use with PMM, open the IAM console
and click *Users* on the navigation pane. Then, select your IAM user.

To create the access key, open the *Security credentials* tab and click the
*Create access key* button. The system automatically generates a new access
key ID and a secret access key that you can provide on the *PMM Add Instance*
dashboard to have your Amazon RDS DB instances discovered.

**NOTE**: You may use an IAM role instead of IAM user provided your Amazon RDS DB
instances are associated with the same AWS account as PMM.

In case, the PMM Server and Amazon RDS DB instance were created by using the
same AWS account, you do not need create the access key ID and secret access
key manually. PMM retrieves this information automatically and attempts to
discover your Amazon RDS DB instances.

## Attaching a policy to an IAM user

The last step before you are ready to create an Amazon RDS DB instance is to
attach the policy with the required permissions to the IAM user.

First, make sure that the Identity and Access Management page is open and open
*Users*. Then, locate and open the IAM user that you plan to use with
Amazon RDS DB instances. Complete the following steps, to apply the policy:


1. On the *Permissions* tab, click the *Add permissions* button.


2. On the *Add permissions* page, click *Attach existing policies directly*.


3. Using the *Filter*, locate the policy with the required permissions (such as *AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy*).


4. Select a checkbox next to the name of the policy and click *Review*.


5. The selected policy appears on the *Permissions summary* page. Click *Add permissions*.

The *AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy* is now added to your IAM user.

## Setting up the Amazon RDS DB Instance

Query Analytics requires Configuring Performance Schema as the query source, because the slow
query log is stored on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) side, and QAN agent is not able to
read it.  Enable the `performance_schema` option under `Parameter Groups`
in Amazon RDS.

**WARNING**: Enabling Performance Schema on T2 instances is not recommended
because it can easily run the T2 instance out of memory.

When adding a monitoring instance for Amazon RDS, specify a unique name to
distinguish it from the local MySQL instance.  If you do not specify a name,
it will use the clientâ€™s host name.

Create the `pmm` user with the following privileges on the Amazon RDS
instance that you want to monitor:

```
GRANT SELECT, PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'pmm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP ON performance_schema.* TO 'pmm'@'%';
```

If you have Amazon RDS with a MySQL version prior to 5.5, `REPLICATION
CLIENT` privilege is not available there and has to be excluded from the above
statement.

**NOTE**: General system metrics are monitored by using the `rds_exporter` Prometheus
exporter which replaces `node_exporter`. `rds_exporter` gives acces to
Amazon Cloudwatch metrics.

`node_exporter`, used in versions of PMM prior to 1.8.0, was not able to
monitor general system metrics remotely.
