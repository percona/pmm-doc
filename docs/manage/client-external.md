# Adding External Services

## Adding general external services

You can collect metrics from an external (custom) exporter on a node when:

* there is already a PMM Agent instance running and,
* this node has been [configured](client-config.md) using the `pmm-admin config` command.

### Usage

```sh
pmm-admin add external [--service-name=<service-name>] [--listen-port=<listen-port>] [--metrics-path=<metrics-path>] [--scheme=<scheme>]
```
