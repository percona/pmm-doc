# Setting up

There are three stages to installing and setting up PMM.

## Set up PMM Server {: #setting-up-pmm-server}

Set up at least one PMM Server.

Choose from:

| Use                  | {{icon.thumbsup}} **Benefits**  | {{icon.thumbsdown}} **Drawbacks**
|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------
| [Docker]             | Quick, simple                   | Docker required, will have additional network configuration needs
| [Virtual appliance]  |                                 |
| [Amazon AWS]         |                                 | Non-free solution (infrastructure)

## Set up PMM Client {: #setting-up-pmm-client}

On every node where there is a service to be monitored, set up PMM Client.

Choose from:

- [Docker](client/index.md#docker)
- [Linux package manager](client/index.md#package-manager) (`apt`, `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`)
- [Binary package](client/index.md#binary-package) (a `.tar.gz` file)

## Add services {: #configure-add-services}

You must configure your services and add them to PMM Server's inventory of monitored systems.

You do this on each node/service being monitored.

The set up depends on which type of service you want to monitor:

- [MySQL and variants](client/mysql.md) (Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster, MariaDB)
- [MongoDB](client/mongodb.md)
- [PostgreSQL](client/postgresql.md)
- [ProxySQL](client/proxysql.md)
- [Amazon RDS](client/aws.md)
- [Microsoft Azure](client/azure.md)
- [Google Cloud Platform](client/google.md) (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- [Linux](client/linux.md)
- [External services](client/external.md)
- [HAProxy](client/haproxy.md)

When you have configured everything correctly, you'll see data in the PMM user interface, in one of the [dashboards](../details/dashboards/) specific to the type of service.

Here's a graphical overview of the steps involved.
