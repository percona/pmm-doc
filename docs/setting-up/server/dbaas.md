# DBaaS

To enable and use the Database as a Service (DBaaS) feature in PMM, see [DBaaS](../../using/dbaas.html).

You can use [free K8s provided by Percona](https://www.percona.com/blog/private-dbaas-with-free-kubernetes-cluster/) for evaluation. 
You can also create K8s on AWS using these [instructions](https://www.percona.com/blog/dbaas-kubernetes-in-under-20-min/).
