# PostgreSQL

PMM Client collects metrics from [PostgreSQL][POSTGRESQL] and [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL][PERCONA_POSTGRESQL] databases.

This page shows how to set up PMM to monitor a PostgreSQL database instance. (Read it completely before starting work.)

Here is an overview of the steps involved.

```plantuml source="_resources/diagrams/Setting-Up_Client_PostgreSQL.puml"
```
## Before you start

- One of these database extensions is installed:
    1. `pg_stat_statements`, the original extension created by PostgreSQL, part of the `Here is an overview of the steps involved.
` package available on Linux.
    1. `pg_stat_monitor`, a new extension created by Percona, based on `pg_stat_statements` and compatible with it.
- [PMM Server is installed](../server/index.md) and running with a known IP address accessible from the client node.
- [PMM Client is installed](index.md) and the [node registered with PMM Server](index.md#register).
- You have superuser (root) access on the client host.
- You have superuser access to any database servers that you want to monitor.

## Create a database account for PMM {: #setting-up-client-user}

We recommend creating a PostgreSQL user for `SUPERUSER` level access.

This user must be able to connect to the `postgres` database where the extension was installed. The PostgreSQL user should have local password authentication enabled to access PMM. To do this, set `ident` to `md5` for the user in the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file.

To create a superuser:

```sql
CREATE USER pmm_user WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******';
```

Or, if your database runs on Amazon RDS:

```sql
CREATE USER pmm_user WITH rds_superuser ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******';
```

## Choose and configure an extension

> <b style="color:goldenrod">Important</b> While we recommend use of the newer `pg_stat_monitor` extension, be aware that it is currently beta status and unsupported.
>
> We recommend using only one. If you use both, you will get duplicate metrics.

- [`pg_stat_statements`](#pg_stat_statements) accumulates data but doesn't provide aggregated statistics or histogram information.

- [`pg_stat_monitor`](#pg_stat_monitor) has all the features of `pg_stat_statements`, and adds bucket-based data aggregation (a feature missing from `pg_stat_statements`).





### `pg_stat_statements`

`pg_stat_statements` is included in the official PostgreSQL `postgresql-contrib` available from your Linux distribution package manager.

**Install on Debian**

```sh
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
```

**Install on Red Hat**

```sh
sudo yum install -y postgresql-contrib
```

**Configure**

1. Add these lines to your `postgresql.conf` file:

    ```sh
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
    track_activity_query_size = 2048 # Increase tracked query string size
    pg_stat_statements.track = all   # Track all statements including nested
    ```

2. Restart your PostgreSQL instance.

3. Install the extension (run in the `postgres` database).

    ```sh
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements SCHEMA public;
    ```








## `pg_stat_monitor`

`pg_stat_monitor` collects statistics and aggregates data in a data collection unit called a *bucket* linked together to form a *bucket chain*.

You can specify:

- the number of buckets (the length of the chain);
- how much space is available for all buckets;
- a time limit for each bucket's data collection (the *bucket expiry*).

When a bucket's expiration time is reached, accumulated statistics are reset and data is stored in the next available bucket in the chain.

When all buckets in the chain have been used, the first bucket is reused and its contents are overwritten.

If a bucket fills before its expiration time is reached, data is discarded.

**Compatibility**

`pg_stat_monitor` has been tested with:

- PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13.
- Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13.

**Install**

There are two ways to install this extension:

- For *Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL*: Using a Linux package manager.

- For *PostgreSQL* or *Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL*: [download and compile the source code](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor#installation).

**Install using a Linux package manager**

The `pg-stat-monitor` extension is included in *Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL*. This can be installed via the `percona-release` package.

### Configuration Parameters

Here are the configuration parameters, available values ranges, and default values. All require a restart of PostgreSQL except for `pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_track_utility` and `pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_normalized_query`.

To make settings permanent, add them to your `postgresql.conf` file before starting your PostgreSQL instance.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_max` (5000-2147483647Â bytes) Default: 5000
:    Defines the limit of shared memory. Memory is used by buckets in a circular manner and is divided between buckets equally when PostgreSQL starts.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_query_max_len` (1024-2147483647 bytes) Default: 1024
:    The maximum size of the query. Long queries are truncated to this length to avoid unnecessary usage of shared memory. This parameter must be set before PostgreSQL starts.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_enable` (0-1) Default: 1 (true).
:    Enables or disables monitoring. A value of `Disable` means that `pg_stat_monitor` will not collect statistics for the entire cluster.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_track_utility` (0-1) Default: 1 (true)
:    Controls whether utility commands (all except SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) are tracked.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_normalized_query` (0-1) Default: 0 (false)
:    By default, a query shows the actual parameter instead of a placeholder. Set to 1 to change to showing value placeholders (as `$n` where `n` is an integer).

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_max_buckets` (1-10) Default: 10
:    Sets the maximum number of available data buckets.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_bucket_time` (1-2147483647 seconds) Default: 60
:    Sets the lifetime of the bucket. The system switches between buckets on the basis of this value.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_object_cache` (50-2147483647) Default: 50
:    The maximum number of objects in the information cache.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_respose_time_lower_bound` (1-2147483647 milliseconds) Default: 1
:    Sets the lower bound of the execution time histogram.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_respose_time_step` (1-2147483647 milliseconds) Default: 1
:    Sets the time value of the steps for the histogram.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_query_shared_buffer` (500000-2147483647 bytes) Default: 500000
:   Sets the query shared buffer size.

`pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_track_planning` (0-1) Default: 1 (true)
:   Whether to track planning statistics.



## Adding PostgreSQL queries and metrics monitoring

You add PostgreSQL metrics and queries monitoring with the following command:

```sh
pmm-admin add postgresql --username=<user name> --password=<password>
```

Where `<user name>` and `<password>` are the PostgreSQL user credentials.

Additionally, two positional arguments can be appended to the command line
flags: a service name to be used by PMM, and a service address. If not
specified, they are substituted automatically as `<node>-postgresql` and
`127.0.0.1:5432`.

The command line and the output of this command may look as follows:

```sh
pmm-admin add postgresql --username=pmm --password=pmm postgres 127.0.0.1:5432
PostgreSQL Service added.
Service ID  : /service_id/28f1d93a-5c16-467f-841b-8c014bf81ca6
Service name: postgres
```

If correct installed and set up, you should be able to see data in PostgreSQL Overview dashboard, and also Query Analytics should contain PostgreSQL queries.

Beside positional arguments shown above you can specify service name and service address with the following flags: `--service-name`, `--host` (the hostname or IP address of the service), and `--port` (the port number of the service). If both flag and positional argument are present, flag gains higher priority. Here is the previous example modified to use these flags:

```sh
pmm-admin add postgresql --username=pmm --password=pmm --service-name=postgres --host=127.0.0.1 --port=270175432
```

It is also possible to add a PostgreSQL instance using a UNIX socket with just the `--socket` flag followed by the path to a socket:

```sh
pmm-admin add postgresql --socket=/var/run/postgresql
```

Capturing read and write time statistics is possible only if `track_io_timing` setting is enabled. This can be done either in configuration file or with the following query executed on the running system:


```sh
ALTER SYSTEM SET track_io_timing=ON;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
