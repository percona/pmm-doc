# Architecture

## PMM Server

PMM Server includes the following tools:

- Query Analytics (QAN) enables you to analyze MySQL query performance over periods of time. In addition to the client-side QAN agent, it includes the following:

    - QAN API is the backend for storing and accessing query data collected by the QAN agent running on a PMM Client.

    - QAN Web App is a web application for visualizing collected Query Analytics data.

- Metrics Monitor provides a historical view of metrics that are critical to a MySQL or MongoDB server instance. It includes the following:

    - [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics), a scalable time-series database. (Replaces [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).)

    - [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is a third-party column-oriented database that facilitates the Query Analytics functionality.

    - [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/) is a third-party dashboard and graph builder for visualizing data aggregated (by VictoriaMetrics or Prometheus) in an intuitive web interface.

    - Percona Dashboards is a set of dashboards for Grafana developed by Percona.

### PMM Client

The PMM Client package consist of the following:

* `pmm-admin` is a command-line tool for managing PMM Client, for example, adding and removing database instances that you want to monitor. ([Read more.](../details/commands/pmm-admin.md)).

* `pmm-agent` is a client-side component a minimal command-line interface, which is a central entry point in charge for bringing the client functionality: it carries on clientâ€™s authentication, gets the client configuration stored on the PMM Server, manages exporters and other agents.

* `node_exporter` is an exporter that collects general system metrics.

* `mysqld_exporter` is an exporter that collects MySQL server metrics.

* `mongodb_exporter` is an exporter that collects MongoDB server metrics.

* `postgres_exporter` is an exporter that collects PostgreSQL performance metrics.

* `proxysql_exporter` is an exporter that collects ProxySQL performance metrics.

To make data transfer from PMM Client to PMM Server secure, all exporters are able to use SSL/TLS encrypted connections, and their communication with the PMM server is protected by the HTTP basic authentication.
