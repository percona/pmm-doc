Starting with PMM 2.37.0 we have introduced *Kubernetes Volumes* dashboard. This dashboard provides insights into your Kubernetes volumes, including capacity and usage, in real-time. 

With this dashboard, you can easily monitor the performance and usage of your volumes and take proactive measures to ensure their performance.
