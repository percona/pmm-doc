# MySQL Redo log (binary log) not enabled

## Description
The binary logs are the change stream of the MySQL instance. It is used for replication and for point in time recovery. Itâ€™s recommended to have them on for point in time recovery purposes, and so replicas can be promoted to primaries. This database instance cannot be a replication source, nor could it provide the needed logs for point in time recovery. Consider enabling the binary logs.

## Rule
`SELECT @@global.log_bin;`


## Resolution
Turn on binary logging by having the log_bin option on the configuration file, and restart the MySQL instance.
