# MongoDB journal enabled

## Description
This check returns a warning if the journal is not enabled. 
This is dangerous because you could have a serious issue for data durability in case of a failure.
For Production systems - Enable journal to ensure that data files are valid/recoverable.

It is always recommended to enable the journal. More recent versions of MongoDB donâ€™t permit the journal to be turned off.  MongoDB enables journaling by default in recent versions (4.0 +).
