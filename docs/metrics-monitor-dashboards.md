# Understanding Dashboards

The Metrics Monitor tool provides a historical view of metrics that are critical to a database server. Time-based graphs are separated into dashboards by themes: some are related to MySQL or MongoDB, others provide general system metrics.

## Opening a Dashboard

The default PMM installation provides more than thirty dashboards. To make it
easier to reach a specific dashboard, the system offers two tools. The
*Dashboard Dropdown* is a button in the header of any PMM page. It lists
all dashboards, organized into folders. Right sub-panel allows to rearrange
things, creating new folders and dragging dashboards into them. Also a text box
on the top allows to search the required dashboard by typing.

With *Dashboard Dropdown*, search the alphabetical list for any dashboard.

## Viewing More Information about a Graph

Each graph has a descriptions to display more information about the monitored
data without cluttering the interface.

These are on-demand descriptions in the tooltip format that you can find by
hovering the mouse pointer over the *More Information* icon at the top left
corner of a graph. When you move the mouse pointer away from the *More Information*
button the description disappears.

Graph descriptions provide more information about a graph without claiming any space in the interface.
