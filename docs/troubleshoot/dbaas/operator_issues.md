# Troubleshooting operators installation

Once OLM is installed, PMM does the following actions to install each operator:

1. Creates a subscription for an operator
2. Approves the first available install plan automatically

Once the install plan is approved OLM will create a corresponding ClusterServiceVersion automatically and install the operator.

During this process the following steps might go wrong

1. Subscription was not created
2. Install plan was not created
3. Installation of CSV failed

## Listing subscriptions

```
 kubectl get sub
NAME                              PACKAGE                           SOURCE                  CHANNEL
dbaas-operator                    dbaas-operator                    percona-dbaas-catalog   stable-v0
percona-server-mongodb-operator   percona-server-mongodb-operator   percona-dbaas-catalog   stable-v1
percona-xtradb-cluster-operator   percona-xtradb-cluster-operator   percona-dbaas-catalog   stable-v1
victoriametrics-operator          victoriametrics-operator          percona-dbaas-catalog   stable-v0
```
Note: Names may may vary depending on the version of PMM youâ€™re using

## Listing install plans

Once subscriptions are created and the catalog operator found a CSV to be installed it creates install plans for each operator which are approved by PMM automatically during the provisioning process. The upgrading process should be approved by a user.

```
kubectl get ip
NAME            CSV                                       APPROVAL   APPROVED
install-6gp4k   percona-xtradb-cluster-operator.v1.11.0   Manual     true
install-77jtx   victoriametrics-operator.v0.29.1          Manual     true
install-7lgsj   victoriametrics-operator.v0.29.1          Manual     true
install-bjmvj   victoriametrics-operator.v0.29.1          Manual     true
```

## Listing CSV or how to be sure that operators were installed

```
kubectl get csv
NAME                                      DISPLAY                                                      VERSION   REPLACES                                  PHASE
