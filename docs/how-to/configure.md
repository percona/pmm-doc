## Diagnostics

On all tabs is a *Diagnostics* section (top-right). Click *Download server diagnostics* to retrieve PMM diagnostics data which can be examined and/or shared with our support team should you need help.

## Metrics resolution

Metrics are collected at three intervals representing low, medium and high resolutions.

The *Metrics Resolution* settings tab contains a radio button with three fixed presets (*Rare*, *Standard* and *Frequent*) and one editable custom preset (*Custom*).

![!image](../_images/PMM_Settings_Metrics_Resolution.jpg)

Each preset is a group of low, medium and high resolutions. The values are in seconds.

!!! note alert alert-primary "Time intervals and resolutions"
    Short time intervals are *high* resolution metrics. Longer time intervals are *low* resolution. So:

    - A low resolution interval *increases* the time between collection, resulting in low-resolution metrics and lower disk usage.
    - A high resolution interval *decreases* the time between collection, resulting in high-resolution metrics and higher disk usage.

The default values (in seconds) for the fixed presets and their resolution names are:

| Editable? | Preset            | Low  | Medium | High |
|-----------|-------------------|------|--------|------|
| No        | Rare              | 300  | 180    | 60   |
| No        | Standard          | 60   | 10     | 5    |
| No        | Frequent          | 30   | 5      | 1    |
| Yes       | Custom (defaults) | 60   | 10     | 5    |

Values for the *Custom* preset can be entered as values, or changed with the arrows.

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    If there is poor network connectivity between PMM Server and PMM Client, or between PMM Client and the database server being monitored, scraping every second may not be possible when the network latency is greater than 1 second.

## Advanced Settings

![!](../_images/PMM_Settings_Advanced_Settings.jpg)

### Data Retention

*Data retention* specifies how long data is stored by PMM Server. By default, time-series data is stored for 30 days. You can adjust the data retention time to balance your system's available disk space with your metrics history requirements.

### Telemetry

The *Telemetry* switch enables gathering and sending basic **anonymous** data to Percona, which helps us to determine where to focus the development and what is the uptake for each release of PMM. Specifically, gathering this information helps determine if we need to release patches to legacy versions beyond support, determining when supporting a particular version is no longer necessary, and even understanding how the frequency of release encourages or deters adoption.

The following information is gathered:

- PMM Version;
- Installation Method (Docker, AMI, OVF);
- the Server Uptime;
- Security Threat Tool Status (enabled or disabled);
- Integrated Alerting Status (enabled or disabled).

We do not gather anything that identify a system, but the following two points should be mentioned:

1. The Country Code is evaluated from the submitting IP address before being discarded.

2. We do create an "instance ID" - a random string generated using UUID v4.  This instance ID is generated to distinguish new instances from existing ones, for figuring out instance upgrades.

The first telemetry reporting of a new PMM Server instance is delayed by 24 hours to allow enough time to disable the service for those that do not wish to share any information.

The landing page for this service, [check.percona.com](https://check.percona.com), explains what this service is.

Grafana’s [anonymous usage statistics](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/#reporting-enabled) is not managed by PMM. To activate it, you must change the PMM Server container configuration after each update.

As well as via the *PMM Settings* page, you can also disable telemetry with the `-e DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` option in your docker run statement for the PMM Server.

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    
    Telemetry is sent straight away; the 24 hour grace period is not honored.

### Check for updates

When active, PMM will automatically check for updates and put a notification in the home page *Updates* dashboard if any are available.

### Security Threat Tool

The [Security Threat Tool] performs a range of security-related checks on a registered instance and reports the findings. It is off by default.

!!! hint alert alert-success "Tip"
    To see the results of checks, select *{{icon.checks}} Security Checks* to open the *Security Checks/Failed Checks* dashboard, and select the *Failed Checks* tab.

Checks are re-fetched and re-run at intervals. There are three customizable check intervals:

| Interval name                 | Value (hours)  |
|------------------------------ |:--------------:|
| *Rare interval*               | 78             |
| *Standard interval* (default) | 24             |
| *Frequent interval*           | 4              |

Checks use the *Standard* interval by default. To change a check's interval:

- Go to {{icon.checks}} *PMM Database Checks*.
- Select *All Checks*.
- In the *Actions* column, select the <i class="uil uil-history"></i> icon.

    ![!](../_images/PMM_Security_Checks_Actions.png)

- Select an interval and click *Save*.

This section lets you upload your public SSH key to access the PMM Server via SSH (for example, when accessing PMM Server as a [virtual appliance](../setting-up/server/virtual-appliance.md)).

![!](../_images/PMM_Settings_SSH_Key.jpg)

Enter your **public key** in the *SSH Key* field and click *Apply SSH Key*.

## Alertmanager integration

Alertmanager manages alerts, de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the appropriate receiver or display component.

This section lets you configure integration of VictoriaMetrics with an external Alertmanager.

!!! hint alert alert-success "Tip"
    If possible, use [Integrated Alerting](../using/alerting.md) instead of Alertmanager.

- The *Alertmanager URL* field should contain the URL of the Alertmanager which would serve your PMM alerts.
- The *Prometheus Alerting rules* field is used to specify alerting rules in the YAML configuration format.

![!](../_images/PMM_Settings_Alertmanager_Integration.jpg)

Fill both fields and click the *Apply Alertmanager settings* button to proceed.

## Percona Platform

This panel is where you connect your PMM server to your Percona Platform Account.

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    Your Percona Platform Account is separate from your PMM User account.

### Connect PMM to Percona Platform

!!! alert alert-info ""
    Disclaimer: Percona Platform is a Preview release and several functionalities are still under development or subject to change. As such, we recommend connecting PMM to Percona Platform only for testing purposes.

Connect your PMM servers to Percona Platform to leverage Platform services that boost the monitoring capabilities of your PMM installations.

To connect to Percona Platform, you need a Percona Account. With a Percona Account you also get access to various Percona services, including Percona Platform, Percona Customer Portal, and Community Forum.

If you don't have a Percona Account, you can create one on the [Percona Account Sign Up](https://id.percona.com/signin/register/) page.

#### Pre-requisites
