# Check Percona Portal account information

When you connect your PMM instances to Percona Platform, PMM gets access to:


-  more alert templates 
-  Registered Advisor Checks for additional database checks
-  Paid Advisor Checks for more advanced database health checks. 
  
Paid checks are available when you  connect to Percona Platform with a customer account.

You can check the list of available Paid Advisor checks in the [Percona Platform documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-platform/checks.html).

When you connect with a customer account, PMM  reveals two new tabs on the main menu, where you can check all the information available for your customer accounts:  **Entitlements** and **Support tickets**:
