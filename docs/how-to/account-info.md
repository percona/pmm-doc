# Check Percona Portal account information

When you connect your PMM instances to Percona Platform, PMM gets access to:

-  more alert templates 
-  Basic Advisor Checks for additional database checks
-  Standard/Premium Advisor Checks for more advanced database health checks.
  
Standard/Premium checks are available when you connect to Percona Platform with a customer account.

You can check the list of available Standard/Premium Advisor checks in the [Percona Platform documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-platform/checks.html) or on the [Percona Platform Subscription plans page](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-platform/subscription).

When you connect with a customer account, PMM  reveals two new tabs on the main menu, where you can check all the information available for your customer accounts:  **Entitlements** and **Support tickets**:
