# About Percona Alerting

!!! alert alert-info ""
    Percona Alerting is the new Alerting feature introduced in PMM 2.31. This replaces the Integrated Alerting feature available in previous versions.  
    
Alerting notifies of important or unusual activity in your database environments so that you can identify and resolve problems quickly. When something needs your attention, PMM automatically sends you an alert through your specified contact points.


PMM 2.31 introduced Percona Alerting which replaces Integrated Alerting in previous PMM versions. In addition to full feature parity, Percona Alerting includes additional benefits like Grafana-based alert rules and a unified, easy-to-use alerting command center on the **Alerting** page.

Percona Alerting is enabled by default in the PMM Settings. This feature adds the **Percona templated alerts** option on the **Alerting** page.
