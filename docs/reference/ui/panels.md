# Panels

Charts, graphs and set-based panels reveal extra information when the mouse is moved over them.

Some panels have an information icon <i class="fa fa-info"></i> in the top left corner. Mouse over this to reveal panel information.

## Panel menu

At the top of each panel and to the right of the panel name is the _panel menu_.

      The menu is hidden until you mouse over it. Look for the <i class="uil uil-angle-down"></i> symbol in the title bar of a panel.
