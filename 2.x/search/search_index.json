Discord chat . PMM project in JIRA . What are the minimum system requirements? \u00b6 Server: Disk: 1 GB per monitored database (1 week data retention) Memory: 2 GB per monitored database CPU: Supports SSE4.2 Client: Disk: 100 MB See also Setting up PMM Server Setting up PMM Client How can I upgrade from version 1? \u00b6 There is no direct software upgrade path. You must set up PMM 2 and connect your existing clients to it. When all data is registered in PMM2 and expired in PMM1, decommission your PMM1 instance. See also Upgrade from PMM1 Percona blog: Running PMM1 and PMM2 Clients on the Same Host How to control data retention? \u00b6 Go to Configuration \u2192 Settings \u2192 Advanced Settings \u2192 Data retention to adjust the value in days. See also Configure data retention How are PMM Server logs rotated? \u00b6 PMM Server embeds multiple components, like Victoria Metrics, Query Analytics, Grafana, managed , PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, etc. (components). All PMM Server component logs are rotated by supervisord . The components\u2019 log rotation settings are stored in *.ini files within the /etc/supervisord.d directory. Those settings define both the maximum size of a log file and the number of log files to keep. The log rotation takes place once the log file reaches its maximum size. What privileges are required to monitor a MySQL instance? \u00b6 SELECT , PROCESS , SUPER , REPLICATION CLIENT , RELOAD See also Setting Up/Client/MySQL . Can I monitor multiple service instances? \u00b6 Yes. You can add multiple instances of MySQL or any other service to be monitored from the same PMM Client. To do this, you provide a unique port and IP address, or a socket for each instance, and specify a unique name for each. (If a name is not provided, PMM uses the name of the PMM Client host.) For example, to add MySQL monitoring for two local MySQL servers: pmm-admin add mysql --username root --password root instance-01 127 .0.0.1:3001 pmm-admin add mysql --username root --password root instance-02 127 .0.0.1:3002 See also pmm-admin add mysql Can I rename instances? \u00b6 Yes, by removing and re-adding with a different name. When you remove a monitoring service, previously collected data remains available in Grafana. However, the metrics are tied to the instance name. So if you add the same instance back with a different name, it will be considered a new instance with a new set of metrics. So if you are re-adding an instance and want to keep its previous data, add it with the same name. Can I add an AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance from a non-default AWS partition? \u00b6 By default, the RDS discovery works with the default aws partition. But you can switch to special regions, like the GovCloud one, with the alternative AWS partitions (e.g. aws-us-gov ) adding them to the Settings via the PMM Server API . To specify other than the default value, or to use several, use the JSON Array syntax: [\"aws\", \"aws-cn\"] . What resolution is used for metrics? \u00b6 The default values (in seconds): Preset Low Medium High Rare 300 180 60 Standard 60 10 5 Frequent 30 5 1 Custom (defaults) 60 10 5 See also Metrics resolution How do I set up Alerting? \u00b6 When a monitored service metric reaches a defined threshold, PMM Server can trigger alerts for it either using the Grafana Alerting feature or by using an external alert manager. With these methods you must configure alerting rules that define conditions under which an alert should be triggered, and the channel used to send the alert (e.g. email). Alerting in Grafana allows attaching rules to your dashboard panels. Grafana Alerts are already integrated into PMM Server and may be simpler to get set up. Alertmanager allows the creation of more sophisticated alerting rules and can be easier to manage installations with a large number of hosts. This additional flexibility comes at the expense of simplicity. We only offer support for creating custom rules to our customers, so you should already have a working Alertmanager instance prior to using this feature. See also PMM Alerting with Grafana: Working with Templated Dashboards How do I use a custom Prometheus configuration file? \u00b6 Normally, PMM Server fully manages the Prometheus configuration file . However, some users may want to change the generated configuration to add additional scrape jobs, configure remote storage, etc. From version 2.4.0, when pmm-managed starts the Prometheus file generation process, it tries to load the /srv/prometheus/prometheus.base.yml file first, to use it as a base for the prometheus.yml file. The prometheus.yml file can be regenerated by restarting the PMM Server container, or by using the SetSettings API call with an empty body. See also API Percona blog: Extending PMM\u2019s Prometheus Configuration How to troubleshoot an Update? \u00b6 See Troubleshoot update . What are my login credentials when I try to connect to a Prometheus Exporter? \u00b6 User name: pmm Password: Agent ID PMM protects an exporter\u2019s output from unauthorized access by adding an authorization layer. To access an exporter you can use pmm as a user name and the Agent ID as a password. You can find the Agent ID corresponding to a given exporter by running pmm-admin list . See also pmm-admin list How to provision PMM Server with non-default admin password? \u00b6 Currently there is no API available to change the admin password. If you\u2019re deploying through Docker you can use the following code snippet to change the password after starting the Docker container: PMM_PASSWORD = \"mypassword\" echo \"Waiting for PMM to initialize to set password...\" until [ \"`docker inspect -f {{.State.Health.Status}} pmm-server`\" = \"healthy\" ] ; do sleep 1 ; done docker exec -t pmm-server bash -c \"grafana-cli --homepath /usr/share/grafana admin reset-admin-password $PMM_PASSWORD \" (This example assumes your Docker container is named pmm-server .)","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#how-can-i-contact-the-developers","text":"Community forum .

A Service represents something useful running on the Node: Amazon Aurora MySQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc. It runs on zero (Amazon Aurora Serverless), single (MySQL), or several (Percona XtraDB Cluster) Nodes. It also has zero or more Agents providing insights for it. An Agent represents something that runs on the Node which is not useful in itself but instead provides insights (metrics, query performance data, etc) about Nodes and/or Services. An agent always runs on the single Node (except External Exporters), and provides insights for zero or more Services and Nodes. Nodes, Services, and Agents have Types which define specific their properties, and their specific logic. Nodes and Services are external by nature \u2013 we do not manage them (create, destroy), but merely maintain a list of them (add to inventory, remove from inventory) in pmm-managed .

API Keys and authentication \u00b6 API keys are used to control access to the PMM server components and resources. With an API key, you are authenticated to the PMM server, have access to PMM server components and resources, and perform various actions on them. You can use API keys as a replacement for basic authentication. Generate API keys \u00b6 PMM uses the Grafana API keys for authentication. Following are the steps to generate the API keys: Login to PMM. From the side menu, click Configuration \u2192 API keys . On the Configuration page, click Add API Key . Add API key dialog box opens. Enter the following to generate an API key: key name (you can give any desired name) Select the Role from the dropdown Enter a value in the Time to live text box (hover on the tooltip for more information). Click Add. API Key Created window displays your newly created key. Make sure to copy your key and keep it secure. Authenticate \u00b6 You can authenticate your request using the HTTPS header. Important Use the -k or --insecure parameter to force cURL to ignore invalid and self-signed SSL certificate errors. The option will skip the SSL verification process, and you can bypass any SSL errors while still having SSL-encrypted communication. However, using the --insecure parameter is not recommended. Although the data transfer is encrypted, it is not entirely secure. For enhanced security of your PMM installation, you need valid SSL certificates.

To make data transfer from PMM Client to PMM Server secure, all exporters are able to use SSL/TLS encrypted connections, and their communication with the PMM server is protected by the HTTP basic authentication.","title":"PMM Client"},{"location":"details/develop-checks.html","text":"Develop Security Checks \u00b6 The Security Threat Tool in PMM offers a set of checks that can detect common security threats, performance degradation, data loss and data corruption. As a developer, you can create custom checks to cover additional use cases that are relevant to your specific database infrastructure. Check components \u00b6 A check is a combination of: SQL query or MongoDB query document for extracting data from the database. Python script for converting extracted data into check results. This is actually a Starlark script \u2013 a Python dialect that adds more imperative features from the Python. Script\u2019s execution environment is sandboxed; no I/O can be done from it. All checks in the first phase (and most of the planned ones) are self-contained. This means that extracted data is processed on the PMM side and not sent back to the SaaS. On the other hand, checks results and other metadata can be sent to SaaS to implement a history feature if the user opted-in and is entitled. For example, below is a single check that returns the static result: --- checks : - version : 1 name : example summary : Example check description : This check is just an example. tiers : [ anonymous , registered ] type : MONGODB_BUILDINFO script : | def check(docs): # for compatibility with PMM Server < 2.12 context = { \"format_version_num\": format_version_num, \"parse_version\": parse_version, } return check_context(docs, context) def check_context(docs, context): # `docs` is a frozen (deeply immutable) list of dicts where each dict represents a single document in result set. # `context` is a dict with additional functions. # # Global `print` and `fail` functions are available. # # `check_context` function is expected to return a list of dicts that are then converted to alerts; # in particular, that list can be empty. # Any other value (for example, string) is treated as script execution failure # (Starlark does not support Python exceptions); # it is recommended to use global function `fail` for that instead. format_version_num = context.get(\"format_version_num\", fail) parse_version = context.get(\"parse_version\", fail) print(\"first doc =\", repr(docs[0])) return [{ \"summary\": \"Example summary\", \"description\": \"Example description\", \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"version\": format_version_num(10203), } }] Here is a much more realistic example: --- checks : - version : 1 name : mongodb_version summary : MongoDB Version description : This check returns warnings if MongoDB/PSMDB version is not the latest one. tiers : [ anonymous , registered ] type : MONGODB_BUILDINFO script : | LATEST_VERSIONS = { \"mongodb\": { \"3.6\": 30620, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6/ \"4.0\": 40020, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/ \"4.2\": 40210, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/ \"4.4\": 40401, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.4/ }, \"percona\": { \"3.6\": 30620, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-3.6/ \"4.0\": 40020, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.0/ \"4.2\": 40209, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.2/ \"4.4\": 40401, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.4/ }, } def check(docs): # for compatibility with PMM Server < 2.12 context = { \"format_version_num\": format_version_num, \"parse_version\": parse_version, } return check_context(docs, context) def check_context(docs, context): # `docs` is a frozen (deeply immutable) list of dicts where each dict represents a single document in result set. # `context` is a dict with additional functions. # # Global `print` and `fail` functions are available. # # `check_context` function is expected to return a list of dicts that are then converted to alerts; # in particular, that list can be empty. # Any other value (for example, string) is treated as script execution failure # (Starlark does not support Python exceptions); # it is recommended to use global function `fail` for that instead. \"\"\" This check returns warnings if MongoDB/PSMDB version is not the latest one. \"\"\" format_version_num = context.get(\"format_version_num\", fail) parse_version = context.get(\"parse_version\", fail) if len(docs) != 1: return \"Unexpected number of documents\" info = docs[0] # extract information is_percona = 'psmdbVersion' in info # parse_version returns a dict with keys: major, minor, patch, rest, num version = parse_version(info[\"version\"]) print(\"version =\", repr(version)) num = version[\"num\"] mm = \"{}.{}\".format(version[\"major\"], version[\"minor\"]) results = [] if is_percona: latest = LATEST_VERSIONS[\"percona\"][mm] if latest > num: results.append({ \"summary\": \"Newer version of Percona Server for MongoDB is available\", \"description\": \"Current version is {}, latest available version is {}.\".format(format_version_num(num), format_version_num(latest)), \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"current\": format_version_num(num), \"latest\": format_version_num(latest), }, }) return results if True: # MongoDB latest = LATEST_VERSIONS[\"mongodb\"][mm] if latest > num: results.append({ \"summary\": \"Newer version of MongoDB is available\", \"description\": \"Current version is {}, latest available version is {}.\".format(format_version_num(num), format_version_num(latest)), \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"current\": format_version_num(num), \"latest\": format_version_num(latest), }, }) return results Check fields \u00b6 Version (integer, required) defines what other check properties are expected, what types are supported, what is expected from the script and what it can expect from the execution environment, etc. Name (string, required) defined machine-readable name (ID). Summary (string, required) defines short human-readable summary. Description (string, required) defines long human-readable description. Type (string/enum, required) defines PMM Service type for which check is performed and query type. Query (string, optional) contains a SQL query or MongoDB query document (as a string with proper quoting) which is executed on the PMM Client side. It may be absent if type defines the whole query by itself. Script (string, required) contains a small Python program that processes query results, and returns check results. It is executed on the PMM Server side. Check script assumes that there is a function with a fixed name check that accepts a list of dicts containing returned rows for SQL databases and documents for MongoDB. It returns zero, one, or several check results that are then converted to alerts. Another function that should be implemented is check_context . PMM 2.12.0 and earlier use context , while newer versions use check_context . Both have the same meaning. The single query means that currently you cannot implement some advanced checks that would require several queries (and can\u2019t be implemented using SQL UNION). Checks format and the current STT UI use different terminology for severities. Here is how different formats show up on the UI: Format UI emergency alert critical error Critical warning Major notice Trivial info debug Backend \u00b6 pmm-managed checks that this installation is opted-in into STT. pmm-managed downloads checks file from SaaS. pmm-managed verifies file signatures using a list of hard-coded public keys. At least one signature should be correct. pmm-managed sends queries to pmm-agent and gathers results. pmm-managed executes check scripts that produce alert information. pmm-managed sends alerts to Alertmanager. Due to Alertmanager design, pmm-managed has to send and re-send alerts to it much more often than the frequency of check execution. That\u2019s expected, and not important for using STT, but important for understanding how it works. Currently, Prometheus is not involved.

Push/Pull modes \u00b6 VictoriaMetrics metrics data can be both \u2018pushed\u2019 to the server and \u2018pulled\u2019 by the server. When setting up services, you can decide which mode to use. The \u2018push\u2019 mode is now default for newly-added services. (In PMM 2.12.0 the default mode was \u2018pull\u2019.) The mode (push/pull) is controlled by the --metrics-mode flag for the pmm-admin config and pmm-admin add commands. If you need to change the metrics mode for an existing Service, you must remove it and re-add it with the same name and the required flags. (You cannot update a service.) Remapped targets for direct Prometheus paths \u00b6 Direct Prometheus paths return structured information directly from Prometheus, bypassing the PMM application. They are accessed by requesting a URL of the form <PMM SERVER URL>/prometheus/<PATH> . As a result of the move to VictoriaMetrics some direct Prometheus paths are no longer available.

As a developer, you can create custom checks to cover additional use cases that are relevant to your specific database infrastructure. Check components \u00b6 A check is a combination of: SQL query or MongoDB query document for extracting data from the database. Python script for converting extracted data into check results. This is actually a Starlark script \u2013 a Python dialect that adds more imperative features from Python. Script\u2019s execution environment is sandboxed so no I/O can be done from it. All checks in the first phase (and most of the planned ones) are self-contained. This means that extracted data is processed on the PMM side and not sent back to the SaaS. On the other hand, checks results and other metadata can be sent to SaaS to implement a history feature if the user opted-in and is entitled. For example, below is a single check that returns the static result: --- checks : - version : 1 name : example summary : Example check description : This check is just an example. tiers : [ anonymous , registered ] type : MONGODB_BUILDINFO script : | def check(docs): # for compatibility with PMM Server < 2.12 context = { \"format_version_num\": format_version_num, \"parse_version\": parse_version, } return check_context(docs, context) def check_context(docs, context): # `docs` is a frozen (deeply immutable) list of dicts where each dict represents a single document in result set. # `context` is a dict with additional functions. # # Global `print` and `fail` functions are available. # # `check_context` function is expected to return a list of dicts that are then converted to alerts; # in particular, that list can be empty. # Any other value (for example, string) is treated as script execution failure # (Starlark does not support Python exceptions); # it is recommended to use global function `fail` for that instead. format_version_num = context.get(\"format_version_num\", fail) parse_version = context.get(\"parse_version\", fail) print(\"first doc =\", repr(docs[0])) return [{ \"summary\": \"Example summary\", \"description\": \"Example description\", \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"version\": format_version_num(10203), } }] Here is a much more realistic example: --- checks : - version : 1 name : mongodb_version summary : MongoDB Version description : This check returns warnings if MongoDB/PSMDB version is not the latest one. tiers : [ anonymous , registered ] type : MONGODB_BUILDINFO script : | LATEST_VERSIONS = { \"mongodb\": { \"3.6\": 30620, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6/ \"4.0\": 40020, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/ \"4.2\": 40210, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.2/ \"4.4\": 40401, # https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.4/ }, \"percona\": { \"3.6\": 30620, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-3.6/ \"4.0\": 40020, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.0/ \"4.2\": 40209, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.2/ \"4.4\": 40401, # https://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-server-mongodb-4.4/ }, } def check(docs): # for compatibility with PMM Server < 2.12 context = { \"format_version_num\": format_version_num, \"parse_version\": parse_version, } return check_context(docs, context) def check_context(docs, context): # `docs` is a frozen (deeply immutable) list of dicts where each dict represents a single document in result set. # `context` is a dict with additional functions. # # Global `print` and `fail` functions are available. # # `check_context` function is expected to return a list of dicts that are then converted to alerts; # in particular, that list can be empty. # Any other value (for example, string) is treated as script execution failure # (Starlark does not support Python exceptions); # it is recommended to use global function `fail` for that instead. \"\"\" This check returns warnings if MongoDB/PSMDB version is not the latest one. \"\"\" format_version_num = context.get(\"format_version_num\", fail) parse_version = context.get(\"parse_version\", fail) if len(docs) != 1: return \"Unexpected number of documents\" info = docs[0] # extract information is_percona = 'psmdbVersion' in info # parse_version returns a dict with keys: major, minor, patch, rest, num version = parse_version(info[\"version\"]) print(\"version =\", repr(version)) num = version[\"num\"] mm = \"{}.{}\".format(version[\"major\"], version[\"minor\"]) results = [] if is_percona: latest = LATEST_VERSIONS[\"percona\"][mm] if latest > num: results.append({ \"summary\": \"Newer version of Percona Server for MongoDB is available\", \"description\": \"Current version is {}, latest available version is {}.\".format(format_version_num(num), format_version_num(latest)), \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"current\": format_version_num(num), \"latest\": format_version_num(latest), }, }) return results if True: # MongoDB latest = LATEST_VERSIONS[\"mongodb\"][mm] if latest > num: results.append({ \"summary\": \"Newer version of MongoDB is available\", \"description\": \"Current version is {}, latest available version is {}.\".format(format_version_num(num), format_version_num(latest)), \"severity\": \"warning\", \"labels\": { \"current\": format_version_num(num), \"latest\": format_version_num(latest), }, }) return results Check fields \u00b6 Version (integer, required) defines what other check properties are expected, what types are supported, what is expected from the script and what it can expect from the execution environment, etc. Name (string, required) defined machine-readable name (ID). Summary (string, required) defines short human-readable summary. Description (string, required) defines long human-readable description. Type (string/enum, required) defines PMM Service type for which check is performed and query type. Query (string, optional) contains a SQL query or MongoDB query document (as a string with proper quoting) which is executed on the PMM Client side. It may be absent if type defines the whole query by itself. Script (string, required) contains a small Python program that processes query results, and returns check results. It is executed on the PMM Server side. Check script assumes that there is a function with a fixed name check that accepts a list of dicts containing returned rows for SQL databases and documents for MongoDB. It returns zero, one, or several check results that are then converted to alerts. Another function that should be implemented is check_context . PMM 2.12.0 and earlier use context , while newer versions use check_context . Both have the same meaning. The single query means that currently you cannot implement some advanced checks that would require several queries (and can\u2019t be implemented using SQL UNION).

Here is how different formats show up on the UI: Format UI emergency alert critical error Critical warning Major notice Trivial info debug Backend \u00b6 pmm-managed checks that this installation is opted-in into STT. pmm-managed downloads checks file from SaaS. pmm-managed verifies file signatures using a list of hard-coded public keys.

Due to Alertmanager design, pmm-managed has to send and re-send alerts to it much more often than the frequency of check execution.

The host name part of an account name can take many forms, and wildcards are permitted: A host value can be a host name or an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). The name \u2018localhost\u2019 indicates the local host. The IP address \u2018127.0.0.1\u2019 indicates the IPv4 loopback interface. The IP address \u2018::1\u2019 indicates the IPv6 loopback interface. The % and _ wildcard characters are permitted in host name or IP address values. These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the LIKE operator. For example, a host value of \u2018%\u2019 matches any host name, whereas a value of \u2018%.mysql.com\u2019 matches any host in the mysql.com domain. \u2018198.51.100.%\u2019 matches any host in the 198.51.100 class C network. Because IP wildcard values are permitted in host values (for example, \u2018198.51.100.%\u2019 to match every host on a subnet), someone could try to exploit this capability by naming a host 198.51.100.somewhere.com. To foil such attempts, MySQL does not perform matching on host names that start with digits and a dot. For example, if a host is named 1.2.example.com, its name never matches the host part of account names. An IP wildcard value can match only IP addresses, not host names. For a host value specified as an IPv4 address, a netmask can be given to indicate how many address bits to use for the network number. Netmask notation cannot be used for IPv6 addresses.

DATABASE COMMANDS \u00b6 MongoDB \u00b6 pmm-admin add mongodb [FLAGS] [node-name] [node-address] Add MongoDB to monitoring. FLAGS: --node-id=node-id Node ID (default is auto-detected). --pmm-agent-id=pmm-agent-id The pmm-agent identifier which runs this instance (default is auto-detected). --username=username MongoDB username. --password=password MongoDB password. --agent-password=password Override the default password for accessing the /metrics endpoint. (Username is pmm and default password is the agent ID.) Avoid using special characters like \u2018', \u2018;\u2019 and \u2018$\u2019 in the custom password. --query-source=profiler Source of queries, one of: profiler , none (default: profiler ). --environment=environment Environment name. --cluster=cluster Cluster name. --replication-set=replication-set Replication set name. --custom-labels=custom-labels Custom user-assigned labels. --skip-connection-check Skip connection check. --tls Use TLS to connect to the database. --tls-skip-verify Skip TLS certificates validation. --tls-certificate-key-file=PATHTOCERT Path to TLS certificate file. --tls-certificate-key-file-password=IFPASSWORDTOCERTISSET Password for TLS certificate file. --tls-ca-file=PATHTOCACERT Path to certificate authority file. --metrics-mode=mode Metrics flow mode for agents node-exporter. Allowed values: - auto : chosen by server (default). - push : agent will push metrics. - pull : server scrapes metrics from agent. Advanced Options \u00b6 PMM starts the MongoDB exporter by default only with diagnosticdata and replicasetstatus collectors enabled. FLAGS: --enable-all-collectors Enable all collectors. --disable-collectors Comma-separated list of collector names to exclude from exporter. --max-collections-limit=-1 Disable collstats, dbstats, topmetrics and indexstats if there are more than collections. 0: No limit. Default is -1, PMM automatically sets this value. A very high limit of max-collections-limit could impact the CPU and Memory usage. Check --stats-collections to limit the scope of collections and DB\u2019s metrics to be fetched. --stats-collections=db1,db2.col1 Collections for collstats & indexstats. Enable all collectors \u00b6 To enable all collectors, pass the parameter --enable-all-collectors in the pmm-admin add mongodb command. This will enable collstats , dbstats , indexstats , and topmetrics collectors. Disable some collectors \u00b6 To enable only some collectors, pass the parameter --enable-all-collectors along with the parameter --disable-collectors . For example, if you want all collectors except topmetrics , specify: --enable-all-collectors --disable-collectors=topmetrics Limit dbStats, collStats and indexStats \u00b6 By default, PMM decides the limit for the number of collections to monitor the collStats and indexStats collectors. You can also set an additional limit for the collStats, indexStats, dbStats, and topmetrics collectors with the \u2013max-collections-limit parameter. Set the value of the parameter --max-collections-limit to: 0: which indicates that collStats and indexStats can handle unlimited collections. n, which indicates that collStats and indexStats can handle <=n collections. If the limit is crossed - exporter stops collecting monitoring data for the collStats and indexStats collectors. -1 (default) doesn\u2019t need to be explicitly set. It indicates that PMM decides how many collections it would monitor, currently <=200 (subject to change). To further limit collections to monitor, enable collStats and indexStats for some databases or collections: Specify the databases and collections that collStats and indexStats will use to collect data using the parameter --stats-collections . This parameter receives a comma-separated list of namespaces in the form database[.collection] . Examples \u00b6 To add MongoDB with all collectors ( diagnosticdata , replicasetstatus , collstats , dbstats , indexstats , and topmetrics ) with default limit detected by PMM (currently <=200 collections, but subject to change): pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass --enable-all-collectors mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 To add MongoDB with all collectors (diagnosticdata, replicasetstatus, collstats, dbstats, indexstats, and topmetrics) with max-collections-limit set to 1000: pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass --enable-all-collectors --max-collections-limit=1000 mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 To enable all the collectors with an unlimited number of collections monitored: pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass --enable-all-collectors --max-collections-limit=0 mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 To add MongoDB with default collectors ( diagnosticdata and replicasetstatus ): pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 Disable collstats collector and enable all the others without limiting max-collections-limit : pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass --enable-all-collectors --max-collections-limit=0 --disable-collectors=collstats mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 If --stats-collections=db1,db2.col1 then the collectors are run as follows: Database Collector is run on db1 All the collections db2 Only for collection col1 Enable all collectors and limit monitoring for dbstats , indexstats , collstats and topmetrics for all collections in db1 and col1 collection in db2 , without limiting max-collections-limit for a number of collections in db1 : pmm-admin add mongodb --username=admin --password=admin_pass --enable-all-collectors --max-collections-limit=0 --stats-collections=db1,db2.col1 mongodb_srv_1 127.0.0.1:27017 Resolutions \u00b6 PMM collects metrics in two resolutions to decrease CPU and Memory usage: high and low resolutions. In high resolution we collect metrics from collectors which work fast: - diagnosticdata - replicasetstatus - topmetrics In low resolution we collect metrics from collectors which could take some time: - dbstats - indexstats - collstats MySQL \u00b6 pmm-admin add mysql [FLAGS] node-name node-address | [--name=service-name] --address=address[:port] | --socket Add MySQL to monitoring. FLAGS: --address MySQL address and port (default: 127.0.0.1:3306). --socket=socket Path to MySQL socket.

For slowlog query source you need change permissions for specific files. Root permissions are needed for this. --size-slow-logs=N Rotate slow log file at this size. If 0 , use server-defined default. Negative values disable log rotation. A unit suffix must be appended to the number and can be one of: KiB , MiB , GiB , TiB for base 2 units (1024, 1048576, etc). --disable-queryexamples Disable collection of query examples. --disable-tablestats Disable table statistics collection. Excluded collectors for low-resolution time intervals: --collect.auto_increment.columns --collect.info_schema.tables --collect.info_schema.tablestats --collect.perf_schema.indexiowaits --collect.perf_schema.tableiowaits --collect.perf_schema.file_instances Excluded collectors for medium-resolution time intervals: --collect.perf_schema.tablelocks --disable-tablestats-limit=disable-tablestats-limit Table statistics collection will be disabled if there are more than specified number of tables (default: server-defined). 0=no limit.

In cases where the mount point is close to 100% consider removing unused files or expanding the space allocated to the mount point. mount point \u00b6 Shows information about the disk space usage of the specified mount point.

Having Free close to 0 B is not good because of the risk of a \u201cdisk full\u201d error that can block one of the services or even cause a crash of the entire system. In cases where Free is close to 0 B consider removing unused files or expanding the space allocated to the mount point. Disk Latency \u00b6 Shows average latency for Reads and Writes IO Devices. Higher than typical latency for highly loaded storage indicates saturation (overload) and is frequent cause of performance problems. Higher than normal latency also can indicate internal storage problems. Disk Operations \u00b6 Shows amount of physical IOs (reads and writes) different devices are serving. Spikes in number of IOs served often corresponds to performance problems due to IO subsystem overload. Disk Bandwidth \u00b6 Shows volume of reads and writes the storage is handling. This can be better measure of IO capacity usage for network attached and SSD storage as it is often bandwidth limited. Amount of data being written to the disk can be used to estimate Flash storage life time. Disk Load \u00b6 Shows how much disk was loaded for reads or writes as average number of outstanding requests at different period of time. High disk load is a good measure of actual storage utilization. Different storage types handle load differently - some will show latency increases on low loads others can handle higher load with no problems. Disk IO Utilization \u00b6 Shows disk Utilization as percent of the time when there was at least one IO request in flight. It is designed to match utilization available in iostat tool. It is not very good measure of true IO Capacity Utilization. Consider looking at IO latency and Disk Load Graphs instead. Avg Disks Operations Merge Ratio \u00b6 Shows how effectively Operating System is able to merge logical IO requests into physical requests.

Doing so doubles amount of writes InnoDB has to do to storage but is required to avoid potential data corruption during the crash on most storage subsystems. InnoDB Fast Shutdown \u00b6 Fast Shutdown means InnoDB will not perform complete Undo Space and Change Buffer cleanup on shutdown, which is faster but may interfere with certain major upgrade operations. InnoDB Open Files \u00b6 Maximum Number of Files InnoDB is Allowed to use. InnoDB File Use \u00b6 Portion of Allowed InnoDB Open Files Use. InnoDB IO Objects \u00b6 InnoDB IO Targets Write Load \u00b6 Write Load Includes both Write and fsync (referred as misc). InnoDB Buffer Pool \u00b6 Buffer Pool Size \u00b6 InnoDB Buffer Pool Size InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory. Knowing how the InnoDB buffer pool works, and taking advantage of it to keep frequently accessed data in memory, is one of the most important aspects of MySQL tuning. The goal is to keep the working set in memory. In most cases, this should be between 60%-90% of available memory on a dedicated database host, but depends on many factors. Buffer Pool Size of Total RAM \u00b6 InnoDB Buffer Pool Size % of Total RAM InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory.

InnoDB Buffer Pool LRU Sub-Chain Churn \u00b6 Buffer Pool Chunk Size \u00b6 Size of the \u201cChunk\u201d for buffer pool allocation. Allocation of buffer pool will be rounded by this number. It also affects the performance impact of online buffer pool resize. Buffer Pool Instances \u00b6 Number of Buffer Pool Instances. Higher values allow to reduce contention but also increase overhead. Read Ahead IO Percent \u00b6 Percent of Reads Caused by InnoDB Read Ahead. Read Ahead Wasted \u00b6 Percent of Pages Fetched by Read Ahead Evicted Without Access. Dump Buffer Pool on Shutdown \u00b6 Load Buffer Pool at Startup \u00b6 Portion of Buffer Pool To Dump/Load \u00b6 Larger Portion increases dump/load time but get more of original buffer pool content and hence may reduce warmup time. Include Buffer Pool in Core Dump \u00b6 Whenever to Include Buffer Pool in Crash Core Dumps. Doing so may dramatically increase core dump file slow down restart. Only makes a difference if core dumping on crash is enabled. InnoDB Old Blocks \u00b6 Percent of The Buffer Pool To be Reserved for \u201cOld Blocks\u201d - which has been touched repeatedly over period of time.

LRU Clean Page Searches \u00b6 When Page is being read (or created) the Page need to be allocated in Buffer Pool. Free List Miss Rate \u00b6 The most efficient way to get a clean page is to grab one from free list. However if no pages are available in Free List the LRU scan needs to be performed. LRU Get Free Loops \u00b6 If Free List was empty LRU Get Free Loop will be performed. It may perform LRU scan or may use some other heuristics and shortcuts to get free page. LRU Scans \u00b6 If Page could not be find any Free list and other shortcuts did not work, free page will be searched by scanning LRU chain which is not efficient. Pages Scanned in LRU Scans \u00b6 Pages Scanned Per Second while doing LRU scans. If this value is large (thousands) it means a lot of resources are wasted. Pages scanned per LRU Scan \u00b6 Number of pages scanned per LRU scan in Average. Large number of scans can consume a lot of resources and also introduce significant addition latency to queries. LRU Get Free Waits \u00b6 If InnoDB could not find a free page in LRU list and had to sleep. Should be zero. InnoDB Checkpointing and Flushing \u00b6 Pages Flushed from Flush List \u00b6 Number of Pages Flushed from \u201cFlush List\u201d This combines Pages Flushed through Adaptive Flush and Background Flush. Page Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 InnoDB Flush Cycle typically Runs on 1 second intervals. If too far off from this number it can indicate an issue. Pages Flushed Per Batch \u00b6 How many pages are flushed per Batch. Large Batches can \u201cchoke\u201d IO subsystem and starve other IO which needs to happen. Neighbor Flushing Enabled \u00b6 Neighbor Flushing is Optimized for Rotational Media and unless you\u2019re Running spinning disks you should disable it. InnoDB Checkpoint Age \u00b6 InnoDB Checkpoint Age The maximum checkpoint age is determined by the total length of all transaction log files ( innodb_log_file_size ). When the checkpoint age reaches the maximum checkpoint age, blocks are flushed synchronously. The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those logs and let the check-pointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you don\u2019t do this, InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time, i.e., when you are busiest. Pages Flushed (Adaptive) \u00b6 Adaptive Flush Flushes pages from Flush List based on the need to advance Checkpoint (driven by Redo Generation Rate) and by maintaining number of dirty pages within set limit. Adaptive Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Adaptive) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Adaptive Batch. Neighbor Flushing \u00b6 To optimize IO for rotational Media InnoDB may flush neighbor pages. It can cause significant wasted IO for flash storage. Generally for flash you should run with innodb_flush_neighbors=0 but otherwise this shows how much IO you\u2019re wasting. Pages Flushed (LRU) \u00b6 Flushing from the tail of the LRU list is needed to keep readily-available free pages for new data to be read when data does not fit in the buffer pool. LRU Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (LRU) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Neighbor. LSN Age Flush Batch Target \u00b6 Target for Pages to Flush due to LSN Age. Pages Flushed (Neighbor) \u00b6 Number of Neighbor pages flushed (If neighbor flushing is enabled) from Flush List and LRU List Combined. Neighbor Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Neighbor) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Neighbor. Sync Flush Waits \u00b6 If InnoDB could not keep up with Checkpoint Flushing and had to trigger Sync flush. This should never happen. Pages Flushed (Background) \u00b6 Pages Flushed by Background Flush which is activated when server is considered to be idle. Background Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Background) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Background Batch. Redo Generation Rate \u00b6 Rate at which LSN (Redo) is Created. It may not match how much data is written to log files due to block size rounding. InnoDB Flushing by Type \u00b6 Pages Evicted (LRU) \u00b6 This correspond to number of clean pages which were evicted (made free) from the tail of LRU buffer. Page Eviction Batches \u00b6 Pages Evicted per Batch \u00b6 Max Log Space Used \u00b6 Single Page Flushes \u00b6 Single Page flushes happen in rare case, then clean page could not be found in LRU list. It should be zero for most workloads. Single Page Flush Pages Scanned \u00b6 Pages Scanned Per Single Page Flush \u00b6 InnoDB IO Capacity \u00b6 Estimated number of IOPS storage system can provide. Is used to scale background activities. Do not set it to actual storage capacity. InnoDB IO Capacity Max \u00b6 InnoDB IO Capacity to use when falling behind and need to catch up with Flushing. InnoDB Logging \u00b6 Total Log Space \u00b6 Number of InnoDB Log Files Multiplied by Their Size. Log Buffer Size \u00b6 InnoDB Log Buffer Size The size of buffer InnoDB uses for buffering writes to log files. At Transaction Commit \u00b6 What to do with Log file At Transaction Commit. Do nothing and wait for timeout to flush the data from Log Buffer, Flush it to OS Cache but not FSYNC or Flush only. Flush Transaction Log Every \u00b6 Every Specified Number of Seconds Flush Transaction Log. InnoDB Write Ahead Block Size \u00b6 This variable can be seen as minimum IO alignment InnoDB will use for Redo log file. High Values cause waste, low values can make IO less efficient. Log Write Amplification \u00b6 How much Writes to Log Are Amplified compared to how much Redo is Generated. Log Fsync Rate \u00b6 Redo Generated per Trx \u00b6 Amount of Redo Generated Per Write Transaction. This is a good indicator of transaction size. InnoDB Log File Usage Hourly \u00b6 InnoDB Log File Usage Hourly Along with the buffer pool size, innodb_log_file_size is the most important setting when we are working with InnoDB. This graph shows how much data was written to InnoDB\u2019s redo logs over each hour. When the InnoDB log files are full, InnoDB needs to flush the modified pages from memory to disk. The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those logs and let the checkpointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you don\u2019t do this, InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time, i.e., when you are busiest. This graph can help guide you in setting the correct innodb_log_file_size . Log Padding Written \u00b6 Amount of Log Padding Written. InnoDB Log File Size \u00b6 InnoDB Log Files \u00b6 Number of InnoDB Redo Log Files. Log Bandwidth \u00b6 Redo Generation Rate \u00b6 Rate at which LSN (Redo) is Created. It may not match how much data is written to log files due to block size rounding. InnoDB Group Commit Batch Size \u00b6 The InnoDB Group Commit Batch Size graph shows how many bytes were written to the InnoDB log files per attempt to write. If many threads are committing at the same time, one of them will write the log entries of all the waiting threads and flush the file. Such process reduces the number of disk operations needed and enlarge the batch size. InnoDB Locking \u00b6 Lock Wait Timeout \u00b6 InnoDB Lock Wait Timeout How long to wait for row lock before timing out. InnoDB Deadlock Detection \u00b6 If Disabled InnoDB Will not detect deadlocks but rely on timeouts. InnoDB Auto Increment Lock Mode \u00b6 Will Define How much locking will come from working with Auto Increment Columns. Rollback on Timeout \u00b6 Whenever to rollback all transaction on timeout or just last statement. Row Lock Blocking \u00b6 Percent of Active Sections which are blocked due to waiting on InnoDB Row Locks. Row Writes per Trx \u00b6 Rows Written Per Transactions which modify rows. This is better indicator of transaction write size than looking at all transactions which did not do any writes as well. Rollbacks \u00b6 Percent of Transaction Rollbacks (as portion of read-write transactions). InnoDB Row Lock Wait Activity \u00b6 InnoDB Row Lock Wait Time \u00b6 InnoDB Row Lock Wait Load \u00b6 Average Number of Sessions blocked from proceeding due to waiting on row level lock. InnoDB Row Locks Activity \u00b6 InnoDB Table Lock Activity \u00b6 Current Locks \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Space and Purging \u00b6 Undo Tablespaces \u00b6 Max Undo Log Size \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Log Truncate \u00b6 Purge Threads \u00b6 Max Purge Lag \u00b6 Maximum number of Unpurged Transactions, if this number exceeded delay will be introduced to incoming DDL statements. Max Purge Lag Delay \u00b6 Current Purge Delay \u00b6 The Delay Injected due to Purge Thread(s) unable to keep up with purge progress. Rollback Segments \u00b6 InnoDB Purge Activity \u00b6 The InnoDB Purge Performance graph shows metrics about the page purging process. The purge process removed the undo entries from the history list and cleanup the pages of the old versions of modified rows and effectively remove deleted rows. Transactions and Undo Records \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Space Usage \u00b6 The InnoDB Undo Space Usage graph shows the amount of space used by the Undo segment. If the amount of space grows too much, look for long running transactions holding read views opened in the InnoDB status. Transaction History \u00b6 InnoDB Purge Throttling \u00b6 Records Per Undo Log Page \u00b6 How Many Undo Operations Are Handled Per Each Undo Log Page. Purge Invoked \u00b6 How Frequently Purge Operation is Invoked. Ops Per Purge \u00b6 Home Many Purge Actions are done Per invocation. Undo Slots Used \u00b6 Number of Undo Slots Used. Max Transaction History Length \u00b6 Purge Batch Size \u00b6 Rseg Truncate Frequency \u00b6 InnoDB Page Operations \u00b6 InnoDB Page Splits and Merges \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Splits graph shows the InnoDB page maintenance activity related to splitting and merging pages. When an InnoDB page, other than the top most leaf page, has too much data to accept a row update or a row insert, it has to be split in two. Similarly, if an InnoDB page, after a row update or delete operation, ends up being less than half full, an attempt is made to merge the page with a neighbor page. If the resulting page size is larger than the InnoDB page size, the operation fails. If your workload causes a large number of page splits, try lowering the innodb_fill_factor variable (5.7+). Page Merge Success Ratio \u00b6 InnoDB Page Reorg Attempts \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Reorgs graph shows information about the page reorganization operations. When a page receives an update or an insert that affect the offset of other rows in the page, a reorganization is needed. If the reorganization process finds out there is not enough room in the page, the page will be split. Page reorganization can only fail for compressed pages. InnoDB Page Reorgs Failures \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Reorgs graph shows information about the page reorganization operations. When a page receives an update or an insert that affect the offset of other rows in the page, a reorganization is needed. If the reorganization process finds out there is not enough room in the page, the page will be split. Page reorganization can only fail for compressed pages. InnoDB Fill Factor \u00b6 The portion of the page to fill then doing sorted Index Build. Lowering this value will worsen space utilization but will reduce need to split pages when new data is inserted in the index. InnoDB Adaptive Hash Index \u00b6 Adaptive Hash Index Enabled \u00b6 Adaptive Hash Index helps to optimize index Look-ups but can be severe hotspot for some workloads. Adaptive Hash Index Partitions \u00b6 How many Partitions Used for Adaptive Hash Index (to reduce contention). Percent of Pages Hashed \u00b6 Number of Pages Added to AHI vs Number of Pages Added to Buffer Pool. AHI Miss Ratio \u00b6 Percent of Searches which could not be resolved through AHI. Rows Added Per Page \u00b6 Number of Rows \u201cHashed\u201d Per Each Page which needs to be added to AHI. AHI ROI \u00b6 How Many Successful Searches using AHI are performed per each row maintenance operation. InnoDB AHI Usage \u00b6 The InnoDB AHI Usage graph shows the search operations on the InnoDB adaptive hash index and its efficiency. The adaptive hash index is a search hash designed to speed access to InnoDB pages in memory. If the Hit Ratio is small, the working data set is larger than the buffer pool, the AHI should likely be disabled. InnoDB AHI Miss Ratio \u00b6 InnoDB AHI Churn - Rows \u00b6 InnoDB AHI Churn - Pages \u00b6 InnoDB Change Buffer \u00b6 Change Buffer Max Size \u00b6 The Maximum Size of Change Buffer (as Percent of Buffer Pool Size).

InnoDB Contention \u00b6 InnoDB Thread Concurrency \u00b6 If Enabled limits number of Threads allowed inside InnoDB Kernel at the same time. InnoDB Commit Concurrency \u00b6 If Enabled limits number of Threads allowed inside InnoDB Kernel at the same time during Commit Stage. InnoDB Thread Sleep Delay \u00b6 The Time the thread will Sleep before Re-Entering InnoDB Kernel if high contention. InnoDB Adaptive Max Sleep Delay \u00b6 If Set to Non-Zero Value InnoDB Thread Sleep Delay will be adjusted automatically depending on the load up to the value specified by this variable. InnoDB Concurrency Tickets \u00b6 Number of low level operations InnoDB can do after it entered InnoDB kernel before it is forced to exit and yield to another thread waiting. InnoDB Spin Wait Delay \u00b6 InnoDB Spin Wait Pause Multiplier \u00b6 InnoDB Sync Spin Loops \u00b6 InnoDB Contention - OS Waits \u00b6 The InnoDB Contention - OS Waits graph shows the number of time an OS wait operation was required while waiting to get the lock. This happens once the spin rounds are exhausted. InnoDB Contention - Spin Rounds \u00b6 The InnoDB Contention - Spin Rounds graph shows the number of spin rounds executed to get a lock. A spin round is a fast retry to get the lock in a loop. InnoDB Misc \u00b6 InnoDB Main Thread Utilization \u00b6 The InnoDB Main Thread Utilization graph shows the portion of time the InnoDB main thread spent at various task. InnoDB Activity \u00b6 The InnoDB Activity graph shows a measure of the activity of the InnoDB threads. InnoDB Dedicated Server \u00b6 InnoDB automatically optimized for Dedicated Server Environment (auto scaling cache and some other variables). InnoDB Sort Buffer Size \u00b6 This Buffer is used for Building InnoDB Indexes using Sort algorithm. InnoDB Stats Auto Recalc \u00b6 Update Stats when Metadata Queried \u00b6 Refresh InnoDB Statistics when meta-data queries by SHOW TABLE STATUS or INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries. If Enabled can cause severe performance issues. Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) \u00b6 Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) is an optimization for the case where MySQL retrieves rows from a table using an index. Without ICP, the storage engine traverses the index to locate rows in the base table and returns them to the MySQL server which evaluates the WHERE condition for the rows. With ICP enabled, and if parts of the WHERE condition can be evaluated by using only columns from the index, the MySQL server pushes this part of the WHERE condition down to the storage engine. The storage engine then evaluates the pushed index condition by using the index entry and only if this is satisfied is the row read from the table. ICP can reduce the number of times the storage engine must access the base table and the number of times the MySQL server must access the storage engine. InnoDB Persistent Statistics \u00b6 InnoDB Persistent Sample Pages \u00b6 Number of Pages To Sample if Persistent Statistics are Enabled. InnoDB Transient Sample Pages \u00b6 Number of Pages To Sample if Persistent Statistics are Disabled. InnoDB Online Operations (MariaDB) \u00b6 InnoDB Defragmentation \u00b6 The InnoDB Defragmentation graph shows the status information related to the InnoDB online defragmentation feature of MariaDB for the optimize table command. To enable this feature, the variable innodb-defragment must be set to 1 in the configuration file. Currently available only on a MariaDB server. InnoDB Online DDL \u00b6 The InnoDB Online DDL graph shows the state of the online DDL (alter table) operations in InnoDB. The progress metric is estimate of the percentage of the rows processed by the online DDL. Currently available only on a MariaDB server. MySQL Summary \u00b6 MySQL Uptime \u00b6 MySQL Uptime The amount of time since the last restart of the MySQL server process. Current QPS \u00b6 Current QPS Based on the queries reported by MySQL\u2019s SHOW STATUS command, it is the number of statements executed by the server within the last second. This variable includes statements executed within stored programs, unlike the Questions variable. It does not count COM_PING or COM_STATISTICS commands. File Handlers Used \u00b6 Table Open Cache Miss Ratio \u00b6 Table Open Cache Size \u00b6 Table Definition Cache Size \u00b6 MySQL Connections \u00b6 Max Connections Max Connections is the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. By default, this is 151. Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires. If the required number of descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value of Max Connections. mysqld actually permits Max Connections + 1 clients to connect. The extra connection is reserved for use by accounts that have the SUPER privilege, such as root. Max Used Connections is the maximum number of connections that have been in use simultaneously since the server started. Connections is the number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server. MySQL Client Thread Activity \u00b6 MySQL Active Threads Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads not sleeping. MySQL Handlers \u00b6 MySQL Handlers Handler statistics are internal statistics on how MySQL is selecting, updating, inserting, and modifying rows, tables, and indexes. This is in fact the layer between the Storage Engine and MySQL. read_rnd_next is incremented when the server performs a full table scan and this is a counter you don\u2019t really want to see with a high value. read_key is incremented when a read is done with an index. read_next is incremented when the storage engine is asked to \u2018read the next index entry\u2019. A high value means a lot of index scans are being done. Top Command Counters \u00b6 Top Command Counters The Com_{{ xxx }} statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. MySQL Network Traffic \u00b6 MySQL Network Traffic Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL. Outbound is network traffic sent from MySQL and Inbound is network traffic MySQL has received. Node Summary \u00b6 System Uptime \u00b6 The parameter shows how long a system has been up and running without a shut down or restart. Load Average \u00b6 The system load is a measurement of the computational work the system is performing. Each running process either using or waiting for CPU resources adds 1 to the load. RAM \u00b6 RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system, application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device\u2019s processor. Memory Available \u00b6 Percent of Memory Available On Modern Linux Kernels amount of Memory Available for application is not the same as Free+Cached+Buffers. Virtual Memory \u00b6 RAM + SWAP Disk Space \u00b6 Sum of disk space on all partitions. It can be significantly over-reported in some installations. Min Space Available \u00b6 Lowest percent of the disk space available. CPU Usage \u00b6 The CPU time is measured in clock ticks or seconds. It is useful to measure CPU time as a percentage of the CPU\u2019s capacity, which is called the CPU usage. CPU Saturation and Max Core Usage \u00b6 When a system is running with maximum CPU utilization, the transmitting and receiving threads must all share the available CPU. This will cause data to be queued more frequently to cope with the lack of CPU. CPU Saturation may be measured as the length of a wait queue, or the time spent waiting on the queue. Disk I/O and Swap Activity \u00b6 Disk I/O includes read or write or input/output operations involving a physical disk. It is the speed with which the data transfer takes place between the hard disk drive and RAM. Swap Activity is memory management that involves swapping sections of memory to and from physical storage. Network Traffic \u00b6 Network traffic refers to the amount of data moving across a network at a given point in time.","title":"MySQL InnoDB Details"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#mysql-innodb-details","text":"Tip If metrics are missing, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client.","title":"MySQL InnoDB Details"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#innodb-activity","text":"","title":"InnoDB Activity"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#writes-rows","text":"","title":"Writes (Rows)"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#writes-transactions","text":"","title":"Writes (Transactions)"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#row-writes-per-trx","text":"Rows Written Per Transactions which modify rows.

By default, this is 151. Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires. If the required number of descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value of Max Connections. mysqld actually permits Max Connections + 1 clients to connect. The extra connection is reserved for use by accounts that have the SUPER privilege, such as root. Max Used Connections is the maximum number of connections that have been in use simultaneously since the server started. Connections is the number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server. MySQL Aborted Connections \u00b6 Aborted Connections \u00b6 When a given host connects to MySQL and the connection is interrupted in the middle (for example due to bad credentials), MySQL keeps that info in a system table (since 5.6 this table is exposed in performance_schema ). If the amount of failed requests without a successful connection reaches the value of max_connect_errors , mysqld assumes that something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection. To allow connections from that host again, you need to issue the FLUSH HOSTS statement. MySQL Client Thread Activity \u00b6 MySQL Active Threads \u00b6 Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads not sleeping. MySQL Thread Cache \u00b6 MySQL Thread Cache \u00b6 The thread_cache_size variable sets how many threads the server should cache to reuse. When a client disconnects, the client\u2019s threads are put in the cache if the cache is not full. It is auto-sized in MySQL 5.6.8 and above (capped to 100). Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created. threads_created : The number of threads created to handle connections. threads_cached : The number of threads in the thread cache. MySQL Slow Queries \u00b6 MySQL Slow Queries \u00b6 Slow queries are defined as queries being slower than the long_query_time setting. For example, if you have long_query_time set to 3, all queries that take longer than 3 seconds to complete will show on this graph. MySQL Select Types \u00b6 MySQL Select Types \u00b6 As with most relational databases, selecting based on indexes is more efficient than scanning an entire table\u2019s data. Here we see the counters for selects not done with indexes. Select Scan is how many queries caused full table scans, in which all the data in the table had to be read and either discarded or returned. Select Range is how many queries used a range scan, which means MySQL scanned all rows in a given range. Select Full Join is the number of joins that are not joined on an index, this is usually a huge performance hit. MySQL Sorts \u00b6 MySQL Sorts \u00b6 Due to a query\u2019s structure, order, or other requirements, MySQL sorts the rows before returning them. For example, if a table is ordered 1 to 10 but you want the results reversed, MySQL then has to sort the rows to return 10 to 1. This graph also shows when sorts had to scan a whole table or a given range of a table to return the results and which could not have been sorted via an index. MySQL Table Locks \u00b6 Table Locks \u00b6 MySQL takes a number of different locks for varying reasons. In this graph we see how many Table level locks MySQL has requested from the storage engine. In the case of InnoDB, many times the locks could actually be row locks as it only takes table level locks in a few specific cases. It is most useful to compare Locks Immediate and Locks Waited. If Locks waited is rising, it means you have lock contention. Otherwise, Locks Immediate rising and falling is normal activity. MySQL Questions \u00b6 MySQL Questions \u00b6 The number of statements executed by the server. This includes only statements sent to the server by clients and not statements executed within stored programs, unlike the Queries used in the QPS calculation. This variable does not count the following commands: COM_PING COM_STATISTICS COM_STMT_PREPARE COM_STMT_CLOSE COM_STMT_RESET MySQL Network Traffic \u00b6 MySQL Network Traffic \u00b6 Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL. Outbound is network traffic sent from MySQL and Inbound is network traffic MySQL has received. MySQL Network Usage Hourly \u00b6 MySQL Network Usage Hourly \u00b6 Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL per hour. You can use the bar graph to compare data sent by MySQL and data received by MySQL. MySQL Internal Memory Overview \u00b6 System Memory : Total Memory for the system. InnoDB Buffer Pool Data : InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory. TokuDB Cache Size : Similar in function to the InnoDB Buffer Pool, TokuDB will allocate 50% of the installed RAM for its own cache. Key Buffer Size : Index blocks for MyISAM tables are buffered and are shared by all threads. key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Adaptive Hash Index Size : When InnoDB notices that some index values are being accessed very frequently, it builds a hash index for them in memory on top of B-Tree indexes. Query Cache Size : The query cache stores the text of a SELECT statement together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client. The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. InnoDB Dictionary Size : The data dictionary is InnoDB\u2019s internal catalog of tables. InnoDB stores the data dictionary on disk, and loads entries into memory while the server is running. InnoDB Log Buffer Size : The MySQL InnoDB log buffer allows transactions to run without having to write the log to disk before the transactions commit. Top Command Counters \u00b6 Top Command Counters \u00b6 The Com_xxx statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. Top Command Counters Hourly \u00b6 Top Command Counters Hourly \u00b6 The Com_xxx statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. MySQL Handlers \u00b6 MySQL Handlers \u00b6 Handler statistics are internal statistics on how MySQL is selecting, updating, inserting, and modifying rows, tables, and indexes. This is in fact the layer between the Storage Engine and MySQL. read_rnd_next is incremented when the server performs a full table scan and this is a counter you don\u2019t really want to see with a high value. read_key is incremented when a read is done with an index. read_next is incremented when the storage engine is asked to \u2018read the next index entry\u2019. A high value means a lot of index scans are being done. MySQL Query Cache Memory \u00b6 MySQL Query Cache Memory \u00b6 The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. This serialization is true not only for SELECTs, but also for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. This also means that the larger the query_cache_size is set to, the slower those operations become. In concurrent environments, the MySQL Query Cache quickly becomes a contention point, decreasing performance. MariaDB and AWS Aurora have done work to try and eliminate the query cache contention in their flavors of MySQL, while MySQL 8.0 has eliminated the query cache feature. The recommended settings for most environments is to set: query_cache_type=0 query_cache_size=0 Tip While you can dynamically change these values, to completely remove the contention point you have to restart the database. MySQL Query Cache Activity \u00b6 MySQL Query Cache Activity \u00b6 The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. This serialization is true not only for SELECTs, but also for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. This also means that the larger the query_cache_size is set to, the slower those operations become. In concurrent environments, the MySQL Query Cache quickly becomes a contention point, decreasing performance. MariaDB and AWS Aurora have done work to try and eliminate the query cache contention in their flavors of MySQL, while MySQL 8.0 has eliminated the query cache feature. The recommended settings for most environments is to set: query_cache_type=0 query_cache_size=0 Tip While you can dynamically change these values, to completely remove the contention point you have to restart the database. MySQL Table Open Cache Status \u00b6 MySQL Table Open Cache Status \u00b6 The recommendation is to set the table_open_cache_instances to a loose correlation to virtual CPUs, keeping in mind that more instances means the cache is split more times. If you have a cache set to 500 but it has 10 instances, each cache will only have 50 cached. The table_definition_cache and table_open_cache can be left as default as they are auto-sized MySQL 5.6 and above (i.e., do not set them to any value). MySQL Open Tables \u00b6 MySQL Open Tables \u00b6 The recommendation is to set the table_open_cache_instances to a loose correlation to virtual CPUs, keeping in mind that more instances means the cache is split more times.

The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time.

It only applies to a secondary host. SQL Thread is a process that runs on a secondary host in the replication environment. It reads the events from the local relay log file and applies them to the secondary server. Depending on the format of the binary log it can read query statements in plain text and re-execute them or it can read raw data and apply them to the local host. Possible values \u00b6 Yes The thread is running and is connected to a replication primary No The thread is not running because it is not launched yet or because an error has occurred connecting to the primary host Connecting The thread is running but is not connected to a replication primary No value The host is not configured to be a replication secondary IO Thread Running is one of the parameters that the command SHOW SLAVE STATUS returns. SQL Thread Running \u00b6 This metric shows if the SQL thread is running or not. It only applies to a secondary host. Possible values \u00b6 Yes SQL Thread is running and is applying events from the relay log to the local secondary host No SQL Thread is not running because it is not launched yet or because of an error occurred while applying an event to the local secondary host Replication Error No \u00b6 This metric shows the number of the last error in the SQL Thread encountered which caused replication to stop. One of the more common errors is Error: 1022 Duplicate Key Entry . In such a case replication is attempting to update a row that already exists on the secondary. The SQL Thread will stop replication to avoid data corruption. Read only \u00b6 This metric indicates whether the host is configured to be in Read Only mode or not. Possible values \u00b6 Yes The secondary host permits no client updates except from users who have the SUPER privilege or the REPLICATION SLAVE privilege. This kind of configuration is typically used for secondary hosts in a replication environment to avoid a user can inadvertently or voluntarily modify data causing inconsistencies and stopping the replication process. No The secondary host is not configured in Read Only mode. MySQL Replication Delay \u00b6 This metric shows the number of seconds the secondary host is delayed in replication applying events compared to when the primary host applied them, denoted by the Seconds_Behind_Master value, and only applies to a secondary host. Since the replication process applies the data modifications on the secondary asynchronously, it could happen that the secondary replicates events after some time. The main reasons are: Network round trip time - high latency links will lead to non-zero replication lag values. Single threaded nature of replication channels - primary servers have the advantage of applying changes in parallel, whereas secondary ones are only able to apply changes in serial, thus limiting their throughput. In some cases Group Commit can help but is not always applicable. High number of changed rows or computationally expensive SQL - depending on the replication format ( ROW vs STATEMENT ), significant changes to the database through high volume of rows modified, or expensive CPU will all contribute to secondary servers lagging behind the primary. Generally adding more CPU or Disk resources can alleviate replication lag issues, up to a point. Binlog Size \u00b6 This metric shows the overall size of the binary log files, which can exist on both primary and secondary servers. The binary log (also known as the binlog ) contains events that describe database changes: CREATE TABLE , ALTER TABLE , updates, inserts, deletes and other statements or database changes. The binlog file is read by secondaries via their IO Thread process to replicate database changes modification on the data and on the table structures. There can be more than one binlog file depending on the binlog rotation policy (for example using the configuration variables max_binlog_size and expire_logs_days ) or because of server reboots. When planning the disk space, take care of the overall dimension of binlog files and adopt a good rotation policy or think about having a separate mount point or disk to store the binlog data. Binlog Data Written Hourly \u00b6 This metric shows the amount of data written hourly to the binlog files during the last 24 hours. This metric can give you an idea of how big is your application in terms of data writes (creation, modification, deletion). Binlog Count \u00b6 This metric shows the overall count of binary log files, on both primary and secondary servers. Binlogs Created Hourly \u00b6 This metric shows the number of binlog files created hourly during the last 24 hours. Relay Log Space \u00b6 This metric shows the overall size of the relay log files. It only applies to a secondary host. The relay log consists of a set of numbered files containing the events to be executed on the secondary host to replicate database changes. The relay log has the same format as the binlog. There can be multiple relay log files depending on the rotation policy adopted (using the configuration variable max_relay_log_size ). As soon as the SQL thread completes to execute all events in the relay log file, the file is deleted. If this metric contains a high value, the variable max_relay_log_file is high too. Generally, this not a serious issue. If the value of this metric is constantly increased, the secondary is delaying too much in applying the events.

CPU Saturation and Max Core Usage \u00b6 When a system is running with maximum CPU utilization, the transmitting and receiving threads must all share the available CPU. This will cause data to be queued more frequently to cope with the lack of CPU. CPU Saturation may be measured as the length of a wait queue, or the time spent waiting on the queue. Interrupts and Context Switches \u00b6 Interrupt is an input signal to the processor indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt signal alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. Context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.

PostgreSQL Connections \u00b6 Max Connections The maximum number of client connections allowed. Change this value with care as there are some memory resources that are allocated on a per-client basis, so setting max_connections higher will generally increase overall PostgreSQL memory usage. Connections The number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the PostgreSQL server. Active Connections The number of open connections to the PostgreSQL server. PostgreSQL Tuples \u00b6 Tuples The total number of rows processed by PostgreSQL server: fetched, returned, inserted, updated, and deleted. Read Tuple Activity The number of rows read from the database: as returned so fetched ones. Tuples Changed per 5 min The number of rows changed in the last 5 minutes: inserted, updated, and deleted ones. PostgreSQL Transactions \u00b6 Transactions The total number of transactions that have been either been committed or rolled back. Duration of Transactions Maximum duration in seconds any active transaction has been running. Temp Files \u00b6 Number of Temp Files The number of temporary files created by queries. Size of Temp files The total amount of data written to temporary files by queries in bytes. All temporary files are taken into account by these two gauges, regardless of why the temporary file was created (e.g., sorting or hashing), and regardless of the log_temp_files setting. Conflicts and Locks \u00b6 Conflicts/Deadlocks The number of queries canceled due to conflicts with recovery in the database (due to dropped tablespaces, lock timeouts, old snapshots, pinned buffers, or deadlocks). Number of Locks The number of deadlocks detected by PostgreSQL. Buffers and Blocks Operations \u00b6 Operations with Blocks The time spent reading and writing data file blocks by back ends, in milliseconds. Tip Capturing read and write time statistics is possible only if track_io_timing setting is enabled. This can be done either in configuration file or with the following query executed on the running system: ALTER SYSTEM SET track_io_timing = ON ; SELECT pg_reload_conf (); Buffers The number of buffers allocated by PostgreSQL. Canceled Queries \u00b6 The number of queries that have been canceled due to dropped tablespaces, lock timeouts, old snapshots, pinned buffers, and deadlocks. Data shown by this gauge are based on the pg_stat_database_conflicts view. Cache Hit Ratio \u00b6 The number of times disk blocks were found already in the buffer cache, so that a read was not necessary. This only includes hits in the PostgreSQL buffer cache, not the operating system\u2019s file system cache. Checkpoint Stats \u00b6 The total amount of time that has been spent in the portion of checkpoint processing where files are either written or synchronized to disk, in milliseconds. PostgreSQL Settings \u00b6 The list of all settings of the PostgreSQL server. System Summary \u00b6 This section contains the following system parameters of the PostgreSQL server: CPU Usage, CPU Saturation and Max Core Usage, Disk I/O Activity, and Network Traffic.","title":"PostgreSQL Dashboards"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-postgresql-instances-overview.html#postgresql-instances-overview","text":"","title":"PostgreSQL Instances Overview"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-postgresql-instances-overview.html#connected","text":"Reports whether PMM Server can connect to the PostgreSQL instance.","title":"Connected"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-postgresql-instances-overview.html#version","text":"The version of the PostgreSQL instance.","title":"Version"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-postgresql-instances-overview.html#shared-buffers","text":"Defines the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers.

Diagnostics \u00b6 On all tabs is a Diagnostics section (top-right). Click Download server diagnostics to retrieve PMM diagnostics data which can be examined and/or shared with our support team should you need help. Metrics resolution \u00b6 Metrics are collected at three intervals representing low, medium and high resolutions. The Metrics Resolution settings tab contains a radio button with three fixed presets ( Rare , Standard and Frequent ) and one editable custom preset ( Custom ). Each preset is a group of low, medium and high resolutions. The values are in seconds. Time intervals and resolutions Short time intervals are high resolution metrics. Longer time intervals are low resolution. So: A low resolution interval increases the time between collection, resulting in low-resolution metrics and lower disk usage. A high resolution interval decreases the time between collection, resulting in high-resolution metrics and higher disk usage. The default values (in seconds) for the fixed presets and their resolution names are: Editable? Preset Low Medium High No Rare 300 180 60 No Standard 60 10 5 No Frequent 30 5 1 Yes Custom (defaults) 60 10 5 Values for the Custom preset can be entered as values, or changed with the arrows. If there is poor network connectivity between PMM Server and PMM Client, or between PMM Client and the database server being monitored, scraping every second may not be possible when the network latency is greater than 1 second. Advanced Settings \u00b6 Data Retention \u00b6 Data retention specifies how long data is stored by PMM Server. By default, time-series data is stored for 30 days. You can adjust the data retention time to balance your system\u2019s available disk space with your metrics history requirements. Telemetry \u00b6 The Telemetry switch enables gathering and sending basic anonymous data to Percona, which helps us to determine where to focus the development and what is the uptake for each release of PMM. Specifically, gathering this information helps determine if we need to release patches to legacy versions beyond support, determining when supporting a particular version is no longer necessary, and even understanding how the frequency of release encourages or deters adoption. The following information is gathered: PMM Version; Installation Method (Docker, AMI, OVF); the Server Uptime; Security Threat Tool Status (enabled or disabled); Integrated Alerting Status (enabled or disabled). We do not gather anything that identify a system, but the following two points should be mentioned: The Country Code is evaluated from the submitting IP address before being discarded. We do create an \u201cinstance ID\u201d - a random string generated using UUID v4. This instance ID is generated to distinguish new instances from existing ones, for figuring out instance upgrades. The first telemetry reporting of a new PMM Server instance is delayed by 24 hours to allow enough time to disable the service for those that do not wish to share any information. The landing page for this service, check.percona.com , explains what this service is. Grafana\u2019s anonymous usage statistics is not managed by PMM. To activate it, you must change the PMM Server container configuration after each update. As well as via the PMM Settings page, you can also disable telemetry with the -e DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 option in your docker run statement for the PMM Server. Telemetry is sent straight away; the 24 hour grace period is not honored. Check for updates \u00b6 When active, PMM will automatically check for updates and put a notification in the home page Updates dashboard if any are available.

Alertmanager integration \u00b6 Alertmanager manages alerts, de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the appropriate receiver or display component. This section lets you configure integration of VictoriaMetrics with an external Alertmanager. Tip If possible, use Integrated Alerting instead of Alertmanager. The Alertmanager URL field should contain the URL of the Alertmanager which would serve your PMM alerts. The Prometheus Alerting rules field is used to specify alerting rules in the YAML configuration format. Fill both fields and click the Apply Alertmanager settings button to proceed. Percona Platform \u00b6 This panel is where you connect your PMM server to your Percona Platform Account. Your Percona Platform Account is separate from your PMM User account. Connect PMM to Percona Platform \u00b6 Disclaimer: Percona Platform is a Preview release and several functionalities are still under development or subject to change. As such, we recommend connecting PMM to Percona Platform only for testing purposes. Connect your PMM servers to Percona Platform to leverage Platform services that boost the monitoring capabilities of your PMM installations. To connect to Percona Platform, you need a Percona Account. With a Percona Account you also get access to various Percona services, including Percona Platform, Percona Customer Portal, and Community Forum. If you don\u2019t have a Percona Account, you can create one on the Percona Account Sign Up page. Pre-requisites \u00b6 To ensure that PMM can establish a connection to Percona Platform: Check that you are a member of an existing Platform organization \u00b6 Log in to Percona Platform using your Percona Account. On the Getting Started page , check that the Create organization step shows an option to view your organization. If you see an option to create a new organization instead, your Percona Account is not linked to any organization yet. If this is the case, contact your account administrator, or create a new organization for your Percona Account. Set the public address of your PMM server \u00b6 In PMM, go to Settings > Advanced Settings . Enter your address/hostname or click Get from browser to enable your browser to automatically detect and populate this field. Save the changes.

To confirm that you have successfully connected the server and check the list of all servers currently connected to an organization, go to Percona Platform > Dashboard tab and click View Instances next to the Connect your PMM step. Disconnect a PMM instance \u00b6 Disconnect a PMM instance when you want to unlink it from your Percona Platform organization or stop monitoring it there. To disconnect a PMM server, go to > Configuration > Settings > Percona Platform and click Disconnect . To confirm that the server disconnected successfully, go to Percona Platform > Dashboard tab > View instances . This displays the PMM instances page where you can check the list of servers currently connected to your Platform organization. Sign into PMM with your Percona Account \u00b6 Once you\u2019ve successfully connected your PMM instance to Percona Platform, you can also sign into PMM usig your Percona Account: Log out of your existing PMM session. On the PMM login screen, click Sign in with Percona Account . If you have an active Percona Account session on the same browser, PMM will log you in automatically. Otherwise, enter your Percona Account credentials to start a new session. Password Reset \u00b6 Password Forgotten \u00b6 In case you forgot your password, click on the Forgot password link on the login page. You will be redirected to a password reset page. Enter the email you are registered with in the field and click on Reset via Email . An email with a link to reset your password will be sent to you. Change Password after Login \u00b6 If you did not forget your password but you still want to change it, go to https://okta.percona.com/enduser/settings (make sure you are logged in). Insert you current password and the new password in the form to the bottom right of the page. If you cannot see the form, you will need to click on the Edit Profile green button (you will be prompted for you password). Click on Change Password .

Pressing this button will force the system to rerun the update so that any broken or not installed components can be installed. In this case, you\u2019ll go through the usual update process with update logs and successful messages at the end. By API call (if UI not available): You can call the Update API directly with: curl --user admin:admin --request POST 'http://PMM_SERVER/v1/Updates/Start' Replace admin:admin with your username/password, and replace PMM_SERVER with your server address. You will not see the logs using this method. Refresh The Home page in 2-5 minutes and you should see that PMM was updated. Client-server connections \u00b6 There are many causes of broken network connectivity. When using Docker the container is constrained by the host-level routing and firewall rules. For example, your hosting provider might have default iptables rules on their hosts that block communication between PMM Server and PMM Client, resulting in DOWN targets in VictoriaMetrics. If this happens, check the firewall and routing settings on the Docker host. PMM is also able to generate diagnostics data which can be examined and/or shared with our support team to help solve an issue. You can get collected logs from PMM Client using the pmm-admin summary command. Logs obtained in this way includes PMM Client logs and logs which were received from the PMM Server, stored separately in the client and server folders. The server folder also contains its own client subfolder with the self-monitoring client information collected on the PMM Server. Beginning with PMM 2.4.0 , there is a flag that enables the fetching of pprof debug profiles and adds them to the diagnostics data. To enable, run pmm-admin summary --pprof . You can get PMM Server logs with either of these methods: Direct download \u00b6 In a browser, visit https://<address-of-your-pmm-server>/logs.zip . From Settings page \u00b6 Select Configuration \u2192 Settings . Click Download server diagnostics . (See Diagnostics in PMM Settings .) Connection difficulties \u00b6 Passwords \u00b6 When adding a service, the host might not be detected if the password contains special symbols (e.g. @ , % , etc.). In such cases, you should convert any password, replacing special characters with their escape sequence equivalents. One way to do this is to use the encodeURIComponent JavaScript function in your browser\u2019s web console (commonly found under a Development Tools menu). Run the function with your password as the parameter. For example: > encodeURIComponent ( \"s3cR#tpa$$worD\" ) will give: \"s3cR%23tpa%24%24worD\" Password change \u00b6 When adding clients to the PMM server, you use the admin user. However, if you change the password for the admin user from the PMM UI, then the clients will not be able to access PMM due to authentication issues. Also, due to multiple unsuccessful login attempts, Grafana will lock out the admin user. In such a scenario, use API key for authentication. You can use API keys as a replacement for basic authentication. Integrated Alerting \u00b6 No Integrated Alerting icon \u00b6 You are not logged in as a privileged user. You need either Admin or Editor roles to work with Integrated Alerting. Integrated Alerting icon but no submenu \u00b6 Integrated Alerting isn\u2019t activated. Go to Configuration \u2192 Settings \u2192 Advanced Settings . Enable Integrated Alerting . Unreachable external IP addresses \u00b6 When I get an email or page from my system the IP is not reachable from outside my organization how do I fix this? To configure your PMM Server\u2019s Public Address, select Configuration \u2192 Settings \u2192 Advanced Settings , and supply an address to use in your alert notifications.

This will continue to work but will be renamed External Alertmanager . Notification channels not working \u00b6 I tried to setup a Slack/Email channel but nothing happened. Before you can use a notification channel you must provide your connection details. Go to PMM \u2192 PMM Settings \u2192 Communication . Define your SMTP server or Slack incoming webhook URL. For PagerDuty you can configure in the notification channel tab of Integrated Alerting by supplying your server/routing key. What\u2019s the difference: Username/Password vs Identity/Secret \u00b6 In configuring my email server I\u2019m being asked for a Username and Password as well as Identity and Secret. What is the difference between these and which do I use or do I need both? It depends on what kind of authentication your system uses: LOGIN : Use Username/Password.

Release Highlights \u00b6 Switch to push metrics by default In PMM 2.12.0, Percona replaced its metrics collection engine (formerly Prometheus) with VictoriaMetrics. Historically, PMM used a pull method with Prometheus while VictoriaMetrics can operate in either a pull or push method. When PMM 2.12.0 was released, Percona kept the default method as pull . Now with PMM 2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to push for all newly-added instances. This blog post describes the two methods and why push benefits users. Also, here is a post by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the push model. Documentation on the push method is here . Note : Installing the 2.14.0 or newer PMM server will change the default behavior on 2.12.0 and 2.13.0 clients from \u201cpull\u201d method to \u201cpush\u201d for any newly added services. Existing services will remain in whatever mode they were prior to upgrade. DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical Preview) In 2.13.0 we introduced Percona\u2019s Database as a Service (DBaaS) which enables non-DBAs (software architects, developers, site reliability engineers, etc.) to perform typical DBA tasks to manage an organization\u2019s database environment via user interfaces and automation orchestration. This release contains several enhancements and fixes, many directly from user feedback. Note : This capability is feature-flagged and turned off by default. Users require a variable to be passed to PMM to expose this functionality. External services presentation on node summary dashboard Improvements to the user experience for adding and viewing external services (any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus exporter such as: non-Percona supported databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization\u2019s external application) on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM.

Note : Installing the 2.14.0 or newer PMM server will change the default behavior on 2.12.0 and 2.13.0 clients from \u201cpull\u201d method to \u201cpush\u201d for any newly added services. Existing services will remain in whatever mode they were prior to upgrade. DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical Preview) In 2.13.0 we introduced Percona\u2019s Database as a Service (DBaaS) which enables non-DBAs (software architects, developers, site reliability engineers, etc.) to perform typical DBA tasks to manage an organization\u2019s database environment via user interfaces and automation orchestration. This release contains several enhancements and fixes, many directly from user feedback. Note : This capability is feature-flagged and turned off by default. Users require a variable to be passed to PMM to expose this functionality. External services presentation on node summary dashboard Improvements to the user experience for adding and viewing external services (any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus exporter such as: non-Percona supported databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization\u2019s external application) on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM.","title":"Release Highlights"},{"location":"release-notes/2.14.0.html#new-features","text":"PMM-5765 : Ability to monitor External Services for situations where PMM Client can\u2019t be installed \u2013 Uses a new command pmm-admin add external-serverless .

Release Highlights \u00b6 PMM 1 vs. 2 Parity Disable collectors during adding node/service to monitoring With this feature users can disable any collector used by PMM to get metrics. When metrics cannot be collected or are no longer needed, disabling the collector(s) prevents PMM from flooding logs and saves infrastructure resources. Our vision for PMM collectors is to provide \u201cstop from collecting\u201d functionality to prevent possible harm to the user environment. This \u201cdisable\u201d feature is an initial step towards the ideal functionality. The full and flexible management for \u201cWhat metrics to collect and in what resolution\u201d is slated for future releases. External services monitoring Since PMM 1.4.0, users had the ability to monitor external services Percona didn\u2019t currently support (e.g., Redis). This blog article from 2018 nicely described external services monitoring at that time. (At that time Percona was not natively supporting a PostgreSQL monitoring service and so this was listed as an external service. Today, PostgreSQL is natively supported by PMM.) Until now, PMM 2.x didn\u2019t support external services monitoring. With this release, any non-natively supported by PMM service will now become supported with external services monitoring. You can see the list of possible exporters to be used in https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/ . Natively-supported services will continue to deliver an expanded set of metrics and insights. Provide summary information for systems ( pt-*-summary actions ) With the addition of pt-*-summary in PMM 2, users can now view summary information about services and nodes on PMM\u2019s dashboard. This summary information is in the industry common format of pt-*-summary tools output to simplify portability of this data. This format will also be preserved in the snapshot of the dashboard shared with Percona Support to simplify investigations of issues. Note: pt-*-summary includes formats for: pt-mysql-summary pt-mongodb-summary pt-pg-summary pt-summary HAProxy support by PMM Users are able to add HAProxy Services for monitoring in PMM2. The support level of them in PMM will be the same we have for ProxySQL, so they will be presented in Inventory and on Dashboard. This will allow users who use HAProxy in their HA configuration to also have this component monitored by PMM. In future releases PMM will start use HAProxy by default for the DBaaS feature and will also use this functionality to monitor HAProxy. DBaaS Preview improvements (Technical Preview) From now you will be able to see the progress of internal steps the system makes when executing some operations with DBaaS. The Progress Bar will not be time-related and will present only steps. The Progress Bar component will also reflect the K8s/Operator-related errors to the user, so in the case of errors, you will have the error text on the UI, and no need to use K8s tools to see the error. With the same UI, you will be able to see the latest logs from K8s so they will have even more information about why the error happened. Known Limitations: The progress bar will not provide valuable information for the Delete operation (will be in a later version when we\u2019ll change the API with Operators Team), Operation of DB Cluster Modification will have \u201cstrange\u201d behavior and will start changes from non-zero values of steps. (This will be modified after API changes.) New Features \u00b6 PMM-4172 , PMM-4306 , PMM-5784 , PMM-7177 : Services and Nodes Summary presentation. Present information about DB\u2019s and Node status using pt-mysql-summary , pt-mongodb-summary , pt-pg-summary outputs (in API and on Dashboards). PMM-7123 : Ability to add External Services via the UI in PMM server. PMM-6711 : Add external-group flag for pmm-admin inventory commands for simpler work with External services. PMM-7405 : Check connection response format when adding External Service to monitoring. PMM-6797 : HAProxy monitoring: Ability to add HAProxy services with pmm-admin [inventory] add [service] haproxy command. PMM-7487 : HAProxy monitoring: Check connection to HAProxy services when adding them for monitoring. PMM-7496 : HAProxy monitoring: New HAProxy PXC dashboards.

PMM-7266 : DBaaS: Cluster creation progress bar \u2013 You can now see the progress of DBaaS DB cluster creation. (The progress bar is based on the number of back-end technical steps, not the time required to perform the tasks.) Improvements \u00b6 PMM-4679 : Docker: :latest tag for pmm-server and pmm-client images has been moved from v1 latest release to v2 latest release. Note : use of the latest tag is not recommended in production environments, instead use :2 tag. PMM-7472 : Remove Prometheus data source \u2013 If you were using custom dashboards with a specified data source (not using empty to use default one) you may need to edit your dashboards to use the proper data source. PMM is no longer using Prometheus but uses compatible storage for metrics from VictoriaMetrics. We renamed the data source to be more technology-agnostic.

PMM-6693 : API keys usage \u2013 PMM users can now use API keys (generated in Grafana UI) for interaction with PMM server instead of username/password pairs. The API key should have the same level of access (Admin or Viewer) as is required for username/password pairs. PMM-7240 : DBaaS: Change from Dashboard to Grafana Page \u2013 We changed the DBaaS page from a Grafana Dashboard to a Grafana Page to be better aligned with the DBaaS enable/disable status and avoid confusion when DBaaS is disabled.

PMM will include them in a Discovery UI where they can be added which will result in node related metrics as well as PostgreSQL database performance metrics. Before this release, this was available only to MySQL-related instances from Amazon RDS. Azure Discovery and Node metrics extraction Technical Preview : PMM will have the same level of support for Microsoft Azure Database as a Service (DBaaS) as we have for AWS\u2019s DBaaS (RDS/Aurora on MySQL or PostgreSQL). You will be able to easily discover and add Azure databases for monitoring by PMM complete with node-level monitoring. This feature is available only if you explicitly activate it on the PMM Settings page. Deactivating it will not remove added services from monitoring, but will just hide the ability to discover and add new Microsoft Azure Services. (This is a feature technical preview because we want to release it as soon as possible to get feedback from users. We are expecting to do more work on this feature to make it more API and resource efficient.) Security Threat Tool Scheduling - Manage execution and execution intervals Security Threat Tool users are now able to control the Security Check execution time intervals for groups of checks, move checks between groups, and disable individual checks if necessary. Support for pg_stat_monitor 0.8 Added compatibility with pg_stat_monitor plugin v 0.8.0 . This is not exposing the new features for the plugin in PMM yet, but ensures Query Analytics metrics are collected to the same degree it was with version 0.6.0 of the plugin. Consistent support of Technical Preview Features Reworked the PMM Settings page to make it clear what features are in Technical Preview vs General Availability (GA) and to simplify activation/deactivation of technical preview features. We also provide a better definition of what a Technical Preview is. Migration of Settings and other service pages in PMM from Grafana dashboards The PMM Settings page and several others (including Add Instance and Inventory ) are being converted to Grafana pages and will no longer be presented as dashboards. Additionally, we\u2019re moving the menu to the sidebar navigation for consistency and more flexibility compared to the older menu structure. Integrated Alerting improvements We released the next stage of improvements in Integrated Alerting functionality of PMM to simplify the usage of the feature. Together with improvements, we continue fixing known bugs in this feature. [DBaaS] Resource planning and prediction (Resource calculator) Technical preview : While creating a DB cluster a user can see a prediction of the resources this cluster will consume with all components as well as the current total and available resources in the K8s. Users will be warned that if they attempt to create a DB cluster it may be unsuccessful because of available resources in the K8s.

Release Highlights \u00b6 Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring Beginning with this release, PMM now supports monitoring of PostgreSQL 14, both - Community edition and Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL . We\u2019ve made significant improvements in exposed data and added additional features if you monitor PostgreSQL together with the pg_stat_monitor extension (Part of Percona distribution for PostgreSQL). These features include: The PostgreSQL queries will have complete Query Execution Plan information. This will help with future optimization of queries and give a clear understanding of query performance Query execution histograms collection and presentation inside Query Analytics for a much more detailed understanding of query executions. Query analytics will both show and let the user drill down to the Top Query of the particular query if it\u2019s a subquery and have this parent query. This feature will allow users to see the dependencies between queries better and understand the impact of subqueries. Query Analytics can filter PostgreSQL queries by query commands like SELECT, UPDATE, etc., and by Application Name if it\u2019s set for PostgreSQL connection from the application.

Important note for users considering docker way upgrade to PMM 2.25.0 If you upgrade from a PMM version less than or equal to 2.23.0 using docker, it will fail if your PMM does not have external access (access to \u2018repo. percona.com\u2019). Thus, it is recommended to upgrade to PMM 2.26.0 instead. See PMM-9416 for more details. Release Highlights \u00b6 Percona Platform (Technology Preview): Connect Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) to Percona Platform to boost the monitoring capabilities of your PMM installations and access all your Percona accounts and services from one single, centralized location. For more information, see the Percona Platform Portal documentation Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring You can now specify custom database names when adding PostgreSQL Servers for monitoring. Previous PMM versions always used the default postgres name instead. Added support for the new version of pg_stat_monitor extension. Release Candidate v1.0.0-rc.1 brings many new PostgreSQL metrics, Dashboards and Query Analytics! To find out about all the features available in the new pg_stat_monitor version, see the pg_stat_monitor User guide Added compatibility for the latest Percona Distributions for PostgreSQL 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 updated on December 7, 2021, which includes the newest version of the pg_stat_monitor extension. Grafana usability enhancements PMM is now using the native Grafana provisioning mechanism for adding dashboards, plug-ins, and data sources. This ensures faster and more reliable upgrading to newer PMM versions. Your existing plug-ins and dashboard changes are preserved during upgrades, but always make sure to back them up before upgrading and check that everything transferred correctly afterward. Added option to change the time zone on dashboards. This selection is preserved while you navigate over Dashboards. If you need to change this setting permanently for your account, change it in your preferences by the URL: https://YOUR_PMM_SERVER/graph/profile DBaaS (Technical Preview) You can now deploy and update your DBaaS created PXC clusters to the latest version of Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator 1.9.0. This enables you to take advantage of the latest features and fixes. PMM environment enhancements The pmm-client docker container can now be started as a sidecar. For users that use PMM client in Kubernetes or build automation around it, you can now start the client as a sidecar container simply by passing a flag. The client will also gracefully handle any instances where the connection to DB is not available. For more details, see the PMM Client documentation Removed support for Ubuntu 16.04. With the support of new products and new versions of already supported products, we also removed old, unsupported software.

For more information, see the Percona Platform Portal documentation Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring You can now specify custom database names when adding PostgreSQL Servers for monitoring. Previous PMM versions always used the default postgres name instead. Added support for the new version of pg_stat_monitor extension. Release Candidate v1.0.0-rc.1 brings many new PostgreSQL metrics, Dashboards and Query Analytics! To find out about all the features available in the new pg_stat_monitor version, see the pg_stat_monitor User guide Added compatibility for the latest Percona Distributions for PostgreSQL 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 updated on December 7, 2021, which includes the newest version of the pg_stat_monitor extension. Grafana usability enhancements PMM is now using the native Grafana provisioning mechanism for adding dashboards, plug-ins, and data sources. This ensures faster and more reliable upgrading to newer PMM versions. Your existing plug-ins and dashboard changes are preserved during upgrades, but always make sure to back them up before upgrading and check that everything transferred correctly afterward. Added option to change the time zone on dashboards. This selection is preserved while you navigate over Dashboards. If you need to change this setting permanently for your account, change it in your preferences by the URL: https://YOUR_PMM_SERVER/graph/profile DBaaS (Technical Preview) You can now deploy and update your DBaaS created PXC clusters to the latest version of Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator 1.9.0. This enables you to take advantage of the latest features and fixes. PMM environment enhancements The pmm-client docker container can now be started as a sidecar. For users that use PMM client in Kubernetes or build automation around it, you can now start the client as a sidecar container simply by passing a flag. The client will also gracefully handle any instances where the connection to DB is not available. For more details, see the PMM Client documentation Removed support for Ubuntu 16.04. With the support of new products and new versions of already supported products, we also removed old, unsupported software. As of this release, we are no longer supporting Ubuntu 16.04 in PMM according to recent anouncements","title":"Release Highlights"},{"location":"release-notes/2.25.0.html#new-features","text":"PMM-9050 : Connect PMM Server to Percona Platform for additional account info in PMM and value added content","title":"New Features"},{"location":"release-notes/2.25.0.html#improvements","text":"PMM-8545 : DBaaS: Support of Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator 1.9.0 in PMM PMM-7677 : Docker container for pmm-client : Option to change behavior and follow sidecar pattern The flags PMM_AGENT_SIDECAR and PMM_AGENT_SIDECAR_SLEEP does this.

If using it, install Docker compose . System requirements: Operating system \u2013 PMM Client runs on any modern 64-bit Linux distribution. It is tested on supported versions of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. (See Percona software support life cycle ). Disk \u2013 A minimum of 100 MB of storage is required for installing the PMM Client package. With a good connection to PMM Server, additional storage is not required. However, the client needs to store any collected data that it cannot dispatch immediately, so additional storage may be required if the connection is unstable or the throughput is low.

In this case, the PMM Client is not installed on the host where the database server is deployed. By using the PMM web interface, you connect to the Amazon RDS DB instance. You only need to provide the IAM user access key (or assign an IAM role) and PMM discovers the Amazon RDS DB instances available for monitoring. First of all, ensure that there is the minimal latency between PMM Server and the Amazon RDS instance. Network connectivity can become an issue for VictoriaMetrics to scrape metrics with 1 second resolution. We strongly suggest that you run PMM Server on AWS (Amazon Web Services) in the same availability zone as Amazon RDS instances. It is crucial that enhanced monitoring be enabled for the Amazon RDS DB instances you intend to monitor. Set the Enable Enhanced Monitoring option in the settings of your Amazon RDS DB instance. Creating an IAM user with permission to access Amazon RDS DB instances \u00b6 It is recommended that you use an IAM user account to access Amazon RDS DB instances instead of using your AWS account. This measure improves security as the permissions of an IAM user account can be limited so that this account only grants access to your Amazon RDS DB instances. On the other hand, you use your AWS account to access all AWS services. The procedure for creating IAM user accounts is well described in the Amazon RDS documentation. This section only goes through the essential steps and points out the steps required for using Amazon RDS with Percona Monitoring and Management. The first step is to define a policy which will hold all the necessary permissions. Then, you need to associate this policy with the IAM user or group. In this section, we will create a new user for this purpose. Creating a policy \u00b6 A policy defines how AWS services can be accessed. Once defined it can be associated with an existing user or group. To define a new policy use the IAM page at AWS. Select the Policies option on the navigation panel and click the Create policy button. On the Create policy page, select the JSON tab and replace the existing contents with the following JSON document. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [{ \"Sid\" : \"Stmt1508404837000\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"rds:DescribeDBInstances\" , \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\" , \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"*\" ] }, { \"Sid\" : \"Stmt1508410723001\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"logs:DescribeLogStreams\" , \"logs:GetLogEvents\" , \"logs:FilterLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:RDSOSMetrics:*\" ]} ] } Click Review policy and set a name to your policy, such as AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy . Then, click the Create policy button. Creating an IAM user \u00b6 Policies are attached to existing IAM users or groups. To create a new IAM user, select Users on the Identity and Access Management page at AWS. Then click Add user and complete the following steps: On the Add user page, set the user name and select the Programmatic access option under Select AWS access type . Set a custom password and then proceed to permissions by clicking the Permissions button. On the Set permissions page, add the new user to one or more groups if necessary. Then, click Review . On the Add user page, click Create user . Creating an access key for an IAM user \u00b6 To discover an Amazon RDS DB instance in PMM, you either need to use the access key and secret access key of an existing IAM user or an IAM role. To create an access key for use with PMM, open the IAM console and click Users on the navigation pane. Then, select your IAM user. To create the access key, open the Security credentials tab and click the Create access key button. The system automatically generates a new access key ID and a secret access key that you can provide on the PMM Add Instance dashboard to have your Amazon RDS DB instances discovered. In case, the PMM Server and Amazon RDS DB instance were created by using the same AWS account, you do not need create the access key ID and secret access key manually. PMM retrieves this information automatically and attempts to discover your Amazon RDS DB instances. Attaching a policy to an IAM user \u00b6 The last step before you are ready to create an Amazon RDS DB instance is to attach the policy with the required permissions to the IAM user. First, make sure that the Identity and Access Management page is open and open Users . Then, locate and open the IAM user that you plan to use with Amazon RDS DB instances. Complete the following steps, to apply the policy: On the Permissions tab, click the Add permissions button. On the Add permissions page, click Attach existing policies directly . Using the Filter , locate the policy with the required permissions (such as AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy ). Select a check-box next to the name of the policy and click Review . The selected policy appears on the Permissions summary page. Click Add permissions . The AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy is now added to your IAM user. Creating an IAM role \u00b6 Instead of creating an IAM user you can create an IAM role for a service, to discover Amazon RDS DB instances automatically without the need for access and secret keys. (But this only works if you are running PMM through AWS.) To create an IAM role open the IAM console and click Roles on the navigation pane. Click the Create role button. Select AWS service and select EC2 for the use case. Click the Next: Permissions button. Find the policy created previously and select it. Click the Next: Tags button. (Optional) Add a metadata tag to the role. Click the Next: Review button. Fill the role name and description. Click the Create role button After the role is created EC2 instances running PMM will have permissions to discover RDS DB instances. It\u2019s also possible to create an IAM role to delegate permissions to an IAM user or to add permissions to a user belonging to another AWS account. See the official AWS documentation on creating IAM roles . Setting up the Amazon RDS DB Instance \u00b6 Query Analytics requires Configuring Performance Schema as the query source, because the slow query log is stored on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) side, and QAN agent is not able to read it. Enable the performance_schema option under Parameter Groups in Amazon RDS. Important Enabling Performance Schema on T2 instances is not recommended because it can easily run the T2 instance out of memory. When adding a monitoring instance for Amazon RDS, specify a unique name to distinguish it from the local instance. If you do not specify a name, it will use the client\u2019s host name. Create the pmm user with the following privileges on the Amazon RDS instance that you want to monitor: CREATE USER 'pmm' @ '%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' ; GRANT SELECT , PROCESS , REPLICATION CLIENT ON * . * TO 'pmm' @ '%' ; ALTER USER 'pmm' @ '%' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10 ; GRANT SELECT , UPDATE , DELETE , DROP ON performance_schema . * TO 'pmm' @ '%' ; Adding an Amazon RDS, Aurora or Remote Instance \u00b6 The preferred method of adding an Amazon RDS database instance to PMM is via the Configuration \u2192 PMM Inventory \u2192 Add Instance menu option. This method supports Amazon RDS database instances that use Amazon Aurora, MySQL, or MariaDB engines, as well as any remote PostgreSQL, ProxySQL, MySQL and MongoDB instances. The following steps are needed to add an Amazon RDS database instance to PMM: In the PMM web interface, go to Configuration \u2192 PMM Inventory \u2192 Add Instance . Select Amazon RDS \u2013 Add a remote instance . Enter the access key ID and the secret access key of your IAM user or leave these fields empty if an IAM role was created. Click the Discover button for PMM to retrieve the available Amazon RDS instances. For the instance that you would like to monitor, select the Start monitoring button. You will see a new page with the number of fields. The list is divided into the following groups: Main details , RDS database , Labels , and Additional options . Some already known data, such as already entered AWS access key , are filled in automatically, and some fields are optional. The Main details section allows you to specify the DNS hostname of your instance, the service name to use within PMM, the port your service is listening on, and the database user name and password. The Labels section allows you to specify labels for the environment, the AWS region and availability zone to be used, the Replication set and Cluster names and also it allows you to set the list of custom labels in a key:value format. The Additional options section contains specific flags which allow you to tune the RDS monitoring. They can allow you to skip connection check, to use TLS for the database connection, not to validate the TLS certificate and the hostname, as well as to disable basic and/or enhanced metrics collection for the RDS instance to reduce costs. Also this section contains a database-specific flag, which would allow Query Analytics for the selected remote database: when adding some remote MySQL, AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance, you will be able to choose using performance schema for the database monitoring; when adding a PostgreSQL instance, you will be able to activate using pg_stat_statements extension; when adding a MongoDB instance, you will be able to choose using Query Analytics MongoDB profiler. Finally press the Add service button to start monitoring your instance. Adding an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance \u00b6 For PostgreSQL, use the same method described above. In the PMM web interface, go to Configuration \u2192 PMM Inventory \u2192 Add Instance .. Select Amazon RDS \u2013 Add a remote instance . At the moment of writing this guide, the Add button doesn\u2019t mention PostgreSQL but the discovery function already supports it. Follow steps 4 to 6 as in the previous section.

Before you start \u00b6 Check that: PMM Server is installed and running with a known IP address accessible from the client node. PMM Client is installed and the node is registered with PMM Server . You have superuser (root) access on the client host. Create a database account for PMM \u00b6 It is good practice to use a non-superuser account to connect PMM Client to the monitored database instance. This example creates a database user with name pmm , password pass , and the necessary permissions. CREATE USER 'pmm' @ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10 ; GRANT SELECT , PROCESS , REPLICATION CLIENT , RELOAD , BACKUP_ADMIN ON * . * TO 'pmm' @ 'localhost' ; Choose and configure a source \u00b6 Decide which source of metrics to use, and configure your database server for it. The choices are Slow query log and Performance Schema . While you can use both at the same time we recommend using only one\u2013there is some overlap in the data reported, and each incurs a small performance penalty. The choice depends on the version and variant of your MySQL instance, and how much detail you want to see. Here are the benefits and drawbacks of Slow query log and Performance Schema metrics sources. Benefits Drawbacks Slow query log 1. More detail. 2. Lower resource impact (with query sampling feature in Percona Server for MySQL). 1. PMM Client must be on same host as database server or have access to slow query log. 2. Log files grow and must be actively managed. Performance Schema 1. Faster parsing. 2. Enabled by default on newer versions of MySQL. 1. Less detail. Data source recommendations \u00b6 Database server Versions Recommended source MySQL 5.1-5.5 Slow query log MySQL 5.6+ Performance Schema MariaDB 10.0+ Performance Schema Percona Server for MySQL 5.7, 8.0 Slow query log Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 Slow query log Slow query log \u00b6 This section covers how to configure a MySQL-based database server to use the slow query log as a source of metrics. Applicable versions \u00b6 Server Versions MySQL 5.1-5.5 MariaDB 10.1.2+ Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10+, 8.0.12+ Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 The slow query log records the details of queries that take more than a certain amount of time to complete. With the database server configured to write this information to a file rather than a table, PMM Client parses the file and sends aggregated data to PMM Server via the Query Analytics part of PMM Agent. Settings \u00b6 Variable Value Description slow_query_log ON Enables the slow query log. log_output 'FILE' Ensures the log is sent to a file. (This is the default on MariaDB.) long_query_time 0 The slow query threshold in seconds. In heavily-loaded applications, many quick queries can affect performance more than a few slow ones. Setting this value to 0 ensures all queries are captured. log_slow_admin_statements ON Includes the logging of slow administrative statements. log_slow_slave_statements ON Enables logging for queries that have taken more than long_query_time seconds to execute on the replica. Examples \u00b6 Configuration file. slow_query_log = ON log_output = FILE long_query_time = 0 log_slow_admin_statements = ON log_slow_slave_statements = ON Session. SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_output = 'FILE' ; SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 0 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_admin_statements = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_slave_statements = 1 ; Slow query log \u2013 extended \u00b6 Some MySQL-based database servers support extended slow query log variables. Applicable versions \u00b6 Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10+, 8.0.12+ Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 MariaDB 10.0 Settings \u00b6 Variable Value Description log_slow_rate_limit 100 Defines the rate of queries captured by the slow query log . A good rule of thumb is 100 queries logged per second. For example, if your Percona Server instance processes 10,000 queries per second, you should set log_slow_rate_limit to 100 and capture every 100 th query for the slow query log . Depending on the amount of traffic, logging could become aggressive and resource consuming. This variable throttles the level of intensity of the data capture without compromising information. log_slow_rate_type \u2018query\u2019 Set so that it applies to queries, rather than sessions. slow_query_log_always_write_time 1 Specifies which queries should ignore sampling. With query sampling this ensures that queries with longer execution time will always be captured by the slow query log, avoiding the possibility that infrequent slow queries might not get captured at all. log_slow_verbosity \u2018full\u2019 Ensures that all information about each captured query is stored in the slow query log. slow_query_log_use_global_control \u2018all\u2019 Configure the slow query log during runtime and apply these settings to existing connections. (By default, slow query log settings apply only to new sessions.) Examples \u00b6 Configuration file (Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster). log_slow_rate_limit = 100 log_slow_rate_type = 'query' slow_query_log_always_write_time = 1 log_slow_verbosity = 'full' slow_query_log_use_global_control = 'all' Configuration file (MariaDB). log_slow_rate_limit = 100 Session (Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster). SET GLOBAL log_slow_rate_limit = 100 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_rate_type = 'query' ; SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_always_write_time = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_verbosity = 'full' ; SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_use_global_control = 'all' ; Slow query log rotation \u00b6 Slow query log files can grow quickly and must be managed. When adding a service with the command line use the pmm-admin option --size-slow-logs to set at what size the slow query log file is rotated. (The size is specified as a number with a suffix. See pmm-admin add mysql .) When the limit is reached, PMM Client will: remove the previous .old slow log file, rename the current file by adding the suffix .old , execute the MySQL command FLUSH LOGS . Only one .old file is kept. Older ones are deleted. You can manage log rotation yourself, for example, with logrotate . If you do, you can disable PMM Client\u2019s log rotation by providing a negative value to --size-slow-logs option when adding a service with pmm-admin add . Performance Schema \u00b6 This section covers how to configure a MySQL-based database server to use Performance Schema as a source of metrics. Applicable versions \u00b6 Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 MariaDB 10.3+ PMM\u2019s MySQL Performance Schema Details dashboard charts the various performance_schema metrics. To use Performance Schema , set these variables. Variable Value Description performance_schema ON Enables Performance Schema metrics. This is the default in MySQL 5.6.6 and higher. performance-schema-instrument 'statement/%=ON' Configures Performance Schema instruments. performance-schema-consumer-statements-digest ON Configures the statements-digest consumer. innodb_monitor_enable all Enables InnoDB metrics counters. Examples \u00b6 Configuration file. performance_schema = ON performance-schema-instrument = 'statement/%=ON' performance-schema-consumer-statements-digest = ON innodb_monitor_enable = all Session. ( performance_schema cannot be set in a session and must be set at server start-up.) UPDATE performance_schema . setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%' ; SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable = all ; MariaDB 10.5.7 or lower \u00b6 There is no Explain or Example data shown by default in Query Analytics when monitoring MariaDB instances version 10.5.7 or lower. A workaround is to set this variable. Variable Value Description performance_schema.setup_instruments 'statement/%' List of instrumented object classes. Session. UPDATE performance_schema . setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES' , TIMED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%' ; UPDATE performance_schema . setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%' ; Transactions MariaDB doesn\u2019t implement queries history for transactions. All queries executed within a transaction won\u2019t have query examples since PMM relies on the performance_schema.events_statements_history to grab the query example but that table won\u2019t have any query executed as part of a transaction. This behavior is because MariaDB doesn\u2019t implement these consumers: events_transactions_current events_transactions_history events_transactions_history_long Query response time \u00b6 Query time distribution is a chart in the Details tab of Query Analytics showing the proportion of query time spent on various activities. It is enabled with the query_response_time_stats variable and associated plugins. Applicable versions \u00b6 Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 ( not Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 .) MariaDB 10.0.4 Set this variable to see query time distribution charts. Variable Value Description query_response_time_stats ON Report query response time distributions . (Requires plugin installation. See below.) Configuration file. query_response_time_stats = ON You must also install the plugins. Session. Check that /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/query_response_time.so exists. Install the plugins and activate. For MariaDB 10.3 : INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME_AUDIT SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; SET GLOBAL query_response_time_stats = ON ; For Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 : INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME_AUDIT SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME_READ SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; INSTALL PLUGIN QUERY_RESPONSE_TIME_WRITE SONAME 'query_response_time.so' ; SET GLOBAL query_response_time_stats = ON ; Tablestats \u00b6 Some table metrics are automatically disabled when the number of tables exceeds a default limit of 1000 tables. This prevents PMM Client from affecting the performance of your database server. The limit can be changed when adding a service on the command line with the two pmm-admin options: pmm-admin option Description --disable-tablestats Disables tablestats collection when the default limit is reached. --disable-tablestats-limit=N Sets the number of tables ( N ) for which tablestats collection is disabled. 0 means no limit. A negative number means tablestats is completely disabled (for any number of tables). User statistics \u00b6 Applicable versions \u00b6 User activity, individual table and index access details are shown on the MySQL User Details dashboard when the userstat variable is set. Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 MariaDB 5.2.0+ Examples \u00b6 Configuration file. userstat = ON Session. SET GLOBAL userstat = ON ; Add service \u00b6 When you have configured your database server, you can add a MySQL service with the user interface or on the command line. When adding a service with the command line, you must use the pmm-admin --query-source=SOURCE option to match the source you\u2019ve chosen and configured the database server for. With the PMM user interface, you select Use performance schema , or deselect it to use slow query log . With the user interface \u00b6 Select Configuration \u2192 PMM Inventory \u2192 Add Instance . Select MySQL \u2013 Add a remote instance . Enter or select values for the fields. Click Add service . If your MySQL instance is configured to use TLS, click on the Use TLS for database connections check box and fill in your TLS certificates and key. On the command line \u00b6 Add the database server as a service using one of these example commands. If successful, PMM Client will print MySQL Service added with the service\u2019s ID and name. Use the --environment and -custom-labels options to set tags for the service to help identify them. Examples \u00b6 TLS connection \u00b6 pmm-admin add mysql --username = user --password = pass --tls --tls-skip-verify --tls-ca = pathtoca.pem --tls-cert = pathtocert.pem --tls-key = pathtocertkey.pem --server-url = http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1 --query-source = perfschema name localhost:3306 Slow query log \u00b6 Default query source ( slowlog ), service name ( {node name}-mysql ), and service address/port ( 127.0.0.1:3306 ), with database server account pmm and password pass . pmm-admin add mysql --username = pmm --password = pass Slow query log source and log size limit (1 gigabyte), service name ( MYSQL_NODE ) and service address/port ( 191.168.1.123:3306 ). pmm-admin add mysql --query-source = slowlog --size-slow-logs = 1GiB --username = pmm --password = pass MYSQL_NODE 192 .168.1.123:3306 Slow query log source, disabled log management (use logrotate or some other log management tool), service name ( MYSQL_NODE ) and service address/port ( 191.168.1.123:3306 ). pmm-admin add mysql --query-source = slowlog --size-slow-logs = -1GiB --username = pmm --password = pass MYSQL_NODE 192 .168.1.123:3306 Default query source ( slowlog ), service name ( {node}-mysql ), connect via socket. pmm-admin add mysql --username = pmm --password = pass --socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock Performance Schema \u00b6 Performance schema query source, service name ( MYSQL_NODE ) and default service address/port ( 127.0.0.1:3306 ). pmm-admin add mysql --query-source = perfschema --username = pmm --password = pass MYSQL_NODE Performance schema query source, service name ( MYSQL_NODE ) and default service address/port ( 127.0.0.1:3306 ) specified with flags. pmm-admin add mysql --query-source = perfschema --username = pmm --password = pass --service-name = MYSQL_NODE --host = 127 .0.0.1 --port = 3306 Identifying services \u00b6 Default query source ( slowlog ), environment labeled test , custom labels setting source to slowlog . (This example uses positional parameters for service name and service address.) pmm-admin add mysql --environment = test --custom-labels = 'source=slowlog' --username = root --password = password --query-source = slowlog MySQLSlowLog localhost:3306 Check the service \u00b6 PMM user interface \u00b6 Select Configuration \u2192 PMM Inventory \u2192 Inventory list . Look in the Services tab for a matching Service Type (MySQL), Service name , Addresses , and any other details entered in the form. Look in the Agents tab to check the desired data source is being used.

Summary Create PMM account and set permissions. Choose, install and configure an extension: pg_stat_statements , or, pg_stat_monitor . Add service. Check service. Before you start \u00b6 Check that: PMM Server is installed and running with a known IP address accessible from the client node. PMM Client is installed and the node is registered with PMM Server . You have superuser (root) access on the client host. You have superuser access to any database servers that you want to monitor. (PMM follows PostgreSQL\u2019s end-of-life policy . For specific details on supported platforms and versions, see Percona\u2019s Software Platform Lifecycle page .) Create a database account for PMM \u00b6 We recommend creating a PMM database account that can connect to the postgres database with the SUPERUSER role. Create a user. This example uses pmm . (Replace ****** with a strong password of your choice.) CREATE USER pmm WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******' ; If your database runs on Amazon RDS: CREATE USER pmm WITH rds_superuser ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******' ; Optionally, you can also set up a connection limit (only if the user is not a SUPERUSER): ALTER USER pmm CONNECTION LIMIT 10 ; PMM must be able to log in locally as this user to the PostgreSQL instance. To enable this, edit the pg_hba.conf file. If not already enabled by an existing rule, add: local all pmm md5 # TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD (Ignore the second line. It is a comment to show field alignment.) Reload the configuration: su - postgres psql -c \"select pg_reload_conf()\" Check local login. psql postgres pmm -c \"\\conninfo\" Enter the password for the pmm user when prompted. Choose and configure an extension \u00b6 Decide which database extension to use, and configure your database server for it. The choices are: pg_stat_statements , the original extension created by PostgreSQL, part of the postgresql-contrib package available on Linux. pg_stat_monitor is a new extension created by Percona. It is based on and compatible with pg_stat_statements . pg_stat_monitor has all the features of pg_stat_statements , but adds bucket-based data aggregation . We recommend choosing only one of these. If you use both, you will get duplicate metrics. Caution While we recommend use of the newer pg_stat_monitor extension, be aware it is currently in beta phase and unsupported. Here are the benefits and drawbacks of each. Benefits Drawbacks pg_stat_statements 1. Part of official postgresql-contrib package. 1. No aggregated statistics or histograms. 2. No Query Examples. pg_stat_monitor 1. Builds on pg_stat_monitor features. 2. Bucket-based aggregation. 1. Beta software. Bucket-based data aggregation pg_stat_monitor collects statistics and aggregates data in a data collection unit called a bucket . These are linked together to form a bucket chain . You can specify: the number of buckets (the length of the chain); how much space is available for all buckets; a time limit for each bucket\u2019s data collection (the bucket expiry ). When a bucket\u2019s expiration time is reached, accumulated statistics are reset and data is stored in the next available bucket in the chain. When all buckets in the chain have been used, the first bucket is reused and its contents are overwritten. If a bucket fills before its expiration time is reached, data is discarded. pg_stat_statements \u00b6 Install \u00b6 Debian/Ubuntu Root permissions apt install -y postgresql-contrib Red Hat/CentOS Root permissions yum install -y postgresql-contrib Configure \u00b6 Add these lines to your postgresql.conf file: shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements' track_activity_query_size = 2048 # Increase tracked query string size pg_stat_statements.track = all # Track all statements including nested track_io_timing = on # Capture read/write stats Restart the database server. After the restart, the extension starts capturing statistics from every database. Install the extension. psql postgres postgres -c \"CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements SCHEMA public\" This command creates the view where you can access the collected statistics. We recommend that you create the extension for the postgres database. In this case, you receive access to the statistics collected from every database.

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13. Install \u00b6 If you use Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL , you can install the extension with your Linux package manager. See Installing Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL . If you use PostgreSQL you can install by downloading and compiling the source code. See Installing pg_stat_monitor . Configure \u00b6 Set or change the value for shared_preload_library . In your postgresql.conf file: shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor' Caution If you use both pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_monitor , set pg_stat_monitor after pg_stat_statements : shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, pg_stat_monitor' Set configuration values. In your postgresql.conf file: pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_query_max_len = 2048 Caution It is important to set maximal length of query to 2048 characters or more for PMM to work properly. You can get a list of other available settings with SELECT * FROM pg_stat_monitor_settings; . See pg_stat_monitor GitHub repository for details about available parameters. Start or restart your PostgreSQL instance. The extension starts capturing statistics from every database. In a psql session: CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor ; This command creates the view where you can access the collected statistics.

For this reason, it is recommended to lower the metrics resolution . Starting with PMM 2.18, the scrape timeout has been updated according to the following rules: For resolutions <= 2 seconds, scrape timeout is 1 second. For resolutions <= 10 seconds, timeout is set to resolution minus 1 second. For example, for 10 second resolution, timeout will be set at 9 seconds. For lower resolutions (values > 10 seconds), the scrape timeout is set to 90% of the resolution time. For example, for 60 second resolution, the scrape timeout will be set to 54 seconds. How to check for scrape timeouts \u00b6 Sometimes it is hard to check if you are using the correct values to scrape or if there some other reason why there is no data in a dashboard even when the instance has been added correctly and the agent is running. One additional step you can do is to check for scrape target statuses. Browse to http://<your-pmm-server-address>/prometheus/targets and then click on the Unhealthy button. The page will show only agents having issues while scrapping and the scrape result including the error messages. In the example here, there is a message that says: context deadline exceeded and the scrape duration column says the scrape took 10 seconds; this means that the exporter didn\u2019t respond in the 10 seconds the scrape process was allowed to run due to the configured metric resolutions and their timeouts. In this case, we can lower the metric resolutions increasing these values as shown in the image below.","title":"Remote instances"},{"location":"setting-up/client/remote.html#remote-instances","text":"","title":"Remote instances"},{"location":"setting-up/client/remote.html#recommended-settings","text":"When monitoring remote instances including RDS and Google instances, network latency might affect the scrape process and throw timeout errors. For this reason, it is recommended to lower the metrics resolution . Starting with PMM 2.18, the scrape timeout has been updated according to the following rules: For resolutions <= 2 seconds, scrape timeout is 1 second. For resolutions <= 10 seconds, timeout is set to resolution minus 1 second. For example, for 10 second resolution, timeout will be set at 9 seconds.

Make sure that you give it a name to distinguish from other instances managed via the EC2 console. Running the instance \u00b6 After you add your new instance it will take some time to initialize it. When the AWS console reports that the instance is now in a running state, you many continue with configuration of PMM Server. When started the next time after rebooting, your instance may acquire another IP address. You may choose to set up an elastic IP to avoid this problem. With your instance selected, open its IP address in a web browser. The IP address appears in the IPv4 Public IP column or as value of the Public IP field at the top of the Properties panel. To run the instance, copy and paste its public IP address to the location bar of your browser. In the Percona Monitoring and Management welcome page that opens, enter the instance ID. You can copy the instance ID from the Properties panel of your instance, select the Description tab back in the EC2 console. Click the Copy button next to the Instance ID field.

The PMM Server is now ready and the home page opens. You are creating a username and password that will be used for two purposes: authentication as a user to PMM - the credentials to log in to PMM. authentication between PMM Server and PMM Clients - you will re-use these credentials on another host when configuring PMM Client for the first time on a server, for example (DO NOT RUN ON THIS PMM SERVER YOU JUST CREATED): pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url = https://admin:admin@<IP Address>:443 For instructions about how to access your instances by using an SSH client, see Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH Make sure to replace the user name ec2-user used in this document with admin . Resizing the EBS Volume \u00b6 Your AWS instance comes with a predefined size which can become a limitation. To make more disk space available to your instance, you need to increase the size of the EBS volume as needed and then your instance will reconfigure itself to use the new size. The procedure of resizing EBS volumes is described in the Amazon documentation: Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Linux . After the EBS volume is updated, PMM Server instance will auto-detect changes in approximately 5 minutes or less and will reconfigure itself for the updated conditions. Upgrading PMM Server on AWS \u00b6 Change Public IP address \u00b6 To assign a public IP address for an Amazon EC2 instance, follow these steps: Allocate Elastic IP address Associate Elastic IP address with a Network interface ID of your EC2 instance If you associate an Elastic IP address to an instance that already has an Elastic IP address associated, this previously associated Elastic IP address will be disassociated but still allocated to your account. Upgrading EC2 instance class \u00b6 Upgrading to a larger EC2 instance class is supported by PMM provided you follow the instructions from the AWS manual . The PMM AMI image uses a distinct EBS volume for the PMM data volume which permits independent resizing of the EC2 instance without impacting the EBS volume. Open the Amazon EC2 console. In the navigation pane, choose PMM Server Instances. Select the instance and choose Actions, Instance state, Stop instance. In the Change instance type dialog box, select the instance type that you want. Choose Apply to accept the new settings and start the stopped instance. Expanding the PMM Data EBS Volume \u00b6 The PMM data volume is mounted as an XFS formatted volume on top of an LVM volume. There are two ways to increase this volume size: Add a new disk via EC2 console or API, and expand the LVM volume to include the new disk volume. Expand existing EBS volume and grow the LVM volume. Expand existing EBS volume \u00b6 To expand the existing EBS volume for increased capacity, follow these steps. Expand the disk from AWS Console/CLI to the desired capacity. Login to the PMM EC2 instance and verify that the disk capacity has increased. For example, if you have expanded disk from 16G to 32G, dmesg output should look like below: [ 535.994494] xvdb: detected capacity change from 17179869184 to 34359738368 You can check information about volume groups and logical volumes with the vgs and lvs commands: vgs VG #PV #LV #SN Attr VSize VFree DataVG 1 2 0 wz--n- <16.00g 0 lvs LV VG Attr LSize Pool Origin Data% Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert DataLV DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool 1.74 ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz-- 15.96g 1.39 1.29 Now we can use the lsblk command to see that our disk size has been identified by the kernel correctly, but LVM2 is not yet aware of the new size.

MongoDB Point-In-Time-Recoverable Backups \u00b6 Caution MongoDB Point-In-Time-Recoverable Backups is part of Backup Management which is a technical preview feature. What is it? \u00b6 Better described by our team mates that develop Percona Backup for MongoDB: Point-in-Time Recovery is restoring a database up to a specific moment. Point-in-Time Recovery includes restoring the data from a backup snapshot and replaying all events that occurred to this data up to a specified moment from oplog slices . Point-in-Time Recovery helps you prevent data loss during a disaster such as crashed database, accidental data deletion or drop of tables, unwanted update of multiple fields instead of a single one. Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR) Backups for MongoDB is new functionality available with PMM 2.23.0 as part of the larger Backup Management feature. This implementation in PMM uses Percona Backup for MongoDB pbm >= 1.6.0 behind the scenes. Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for achieving consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. Percona Backup for MongoDB supports Percona Server for MongoDB and MongoDB Community v3.6 or higher with MongoDB Replication enabled. Learn more about Percona Backup for MongoDB . How does it work? \u00b6 Enabling PITR \u00b6 The very first thing you want to do is to enable PITR. Here\u2019s how: Go to Backup Management . Select Scheduled Backups .

Selecting one reduces the Overview list to those items matching the filter. The first five of each category are shown. If there are more, the list is expanded by clicking Show all beside the category name, and collapsed again with Show top 5 . Applying a filter may make other filters inapplicable. These become grayed out and inactive. Click the chart symbol to navigate directly to an item\u2019s associated dashboard. Separately, the global Time range setting filters results by time, either your choice of Absolute time range , or one of the predefined Relative time ranges . Overview Panel \u00b6 To the right of the Filters panel and occupying the upper part of the dashboard is the Overview panel. Each row of the table represents the metrics for a chosen object type, one of: Query; Service Name; Database; Schema; User Name; Client Host. At the top of the second column is the dimension menu. Use this to choose the object type. On the right side of the dimension column is the Dimension Search bar. Enter a string and press Enter to limit the view to queries containing only the specified keywords. Delete the search text and press Enter to see the full list again. Columns \u00b6 The first column is the object\u2019s identifier. For Query , it is the query\u2019s Fingerprint . The second column is the Main metric , containing a reduced graphical representation of the metric over time, called a sparkline , and a horizontal meter, filled to reflect a percentage of the total value. Additional values are revealed as mouse-over tool-tips. Tool-tips \u00b6 For the Query dimension, hovering over the information icon reveals the query ID and its example. Hovering on a column header reveals an informative tool-tip for that column. Hovering on the main metric sparkline highlights the data point and a tooltip shows the data value under the cursor. Hovering on the main metric meter reveals the percentage of the total, and other details specific to the main metric. Hovering on column values reveals more details on the value. The contents depends on the type of value. Adding and removing columns \u00b6 Metrics columns are added with the Add column button. When clicked, a text field and list of available metrics are revealed. Select a metric or enter a search string to reduce the list. Selecting a metric adds it to the panel. A metric column is removed by clicking on the column heading and selecting Remove column . The value plotted in the main metric column can be changed by clicking a metric column heading and selecting Swap with main metric . Sorting \u00b6 The entire list is sorted by one of the columns. Click either the up or down caret to sort the list by that column\u2019s ascending or descending values. Pagination \u00b6 The pagination device lets you move forwards or backwards through pages, jump to a specific page, and choose how many items are listed per page. Queries are grouped into pages of 25, 50 or 100 items. Details Panel \u00b6 Selecting an item in the Overview panel opens the Details panel with a Details Tab . If the dimension is Query , the panel also contains the Examples Tab , Explain Tab , and Tables Tab . Details Tab \u00b6 The Details tab contains a Query time distribution bar (only for MySQL databases) and a set of Metrics in collapsible subpanels. The Query time distribution bar shows a query\u2019s total time made up of colored segments, each segment representing the proportion of time spent on a named activity. query_time : Statement execution time. lock_time : Time to acquire locks. blk_read_time : Total time the statement spent reading blocks (if track_io_timing is enabled, otherwise zero). blk_write_time : Total time the statement spent writing blocks (if track_io_timing is enabled, otherwise zero). innodb_io_r_wait : Time for InnoDB to read the data from storage. innodb_queue_wait : Time the query spent either waiting to enter the InnoDB queue, or in it pending execution. innodb_rec_lock_wait : Time the query waited for row locks. other : Remaining uncategorized query time. Metrics is a table with headings: Metric : The Metric name, with a question-mark tool-tip that reveals a description of the metric on mouse-over; Rate/Second : A sparkline chart of real-time values per unit time; Sum : A summation of the metric for the selected query, and the percentage of the total; Per Query Stats : The value of the metric per query. Each row in the table is a metric. The contents depends on the chosen dimension. For PostgreSQL queries (when using pg_stat_monitor ) the top query will also be shown in the details section if the query was called by an outer query. Other usefull metrics (when using pg_stat_monitor ) to monitor PostgreSQL Server performance are Histograms . Histograms provide more explicit information about number of queries for fingerprint (queryid). Ranges are from 0 seconds up to 100 seconds. Ranges (numbers are in miliseconds): 0 - 3 3 - 10 10 - 31 31 - 100 100 - 316 316 - 1000 1000 - 3162 3162 - 10000 10000 - 31622 31622 - 100000 Here is picture of histogram in graph: Examples Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Examples tab shows an example of the selected query\u2019s fingerprint or table element. Query example and fingerprint can be truncated to 1024 long to reduce space usage. In this case, the query explains section will not work. Explain Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Explain tab shows the explain output for the selected query, in Classic or JSON formats. MySQL: Classic and JSON. MongoDB: JSON only. PostgreSQL: Not supported. \u2018Explain\u2019 for MongoDB To run Explain you need the same permissions as for executing the original query. For example, to run explain on updates you need update permissions. Example: Grant the explainRole with update permissions. db.grantPrivilegesToRole( \"explainRole\", [ { resource: { db: \"\", collection: \"\" }, actions: [ \"update\" ] } ]) Tables Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Tables tab shows information on the tables and indexes involved in the selected query. Plan Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Plan tab shows the plan for PostgreSQL queries (only available when using pg_stat_monitor ). Query Analytics for MongoDB \u00b6 MongoDB is conceptually different from relational database management systems, such as MySQL and MariaDB. Relational database management systems store data in tables that represent single entities. Complex objects are represented by linking tables. In contrast, MongoDB uses the concept of a document where all essential information for a complex object is stored in one place. Query Analytics can monitor MongoDB queries. Although MongoDB is not a relational database management system, you analyze its databases and collections in the same interface using the same tools. Sharing a link for Query Analytics \u00b6 To share a link for Query Analytics, use Copy Link . It copies the link to the clipboard with all the relevant information such as selected query, table page, selected filters, details tab, and time range. Thus, when you open the link, it will display the exact information. Ensure that you use Copy Link to copy the link instead of using the browser address bar or the standard Grafana functionality (to share a dashboard). Otherwise, Query Analytics might not display the exact information that existed while sharing the link. By default, Grafana uses a relative time range and not an absolute range, so it will have a different timestamp when this link is opened.","title":"Query Analytics"},{"location":"using/query-analytics.html#query-analytics","text":"The Query Analytics dashboard shows how queries are executed and where they spend their time.
