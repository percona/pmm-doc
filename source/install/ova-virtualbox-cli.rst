VirtualBox Using the Command Line
================================================================================

Instead of using the VirtualBox GUI, you can do everything on the command
line. Use the ``VBoxManage`` command to import, configure, and start the
appliance.

The following script imports the PMM Server appliance from
``PMM-Server-1.6.0.ova`` and configures it to bridge the `en0` adapter from the
host.  Then the script routes console output from the appliance to
``/tmp/pmm-server-console.log``.  This is done because the script then starts the
appliance in headless (without the console) mode.

To get the IP address for accessing PMM, the script waits for 1 minute until the
appliance boots up and returns the lines with the IP address from the log file.

.. code-block:: text

   # Import image
   VBoxManage import pmm-server-|VERSION NUMBER|.ova

   # Modify NIC settings if needed
   VBoxManage list bridgedifs
   VBoxManage modifyvm 'PMM Server [VERSION NUMBER]' --nic1 bridged --bridgeadapter1 'en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)'

   # Log console output into file
   VBoxManage modifyvm 'PMM Server [VERSION NUMBER]' --uart1 0x3F8 4 --uartmode1 file /tmp/pmm-server-console.log

   # Start instance
   VBoxManage startvm --type headless 'PMM Server [VERSION NUMBER]'

   # Wait for 1 minute and get IP address from the log
   sleep 60
   grep cloud-init /tmp/pmm-server-console.log

In this script, :code:`[VERSION NUMBER]` is the placeholder of the version of
PMM Server that you are installing. By convention **OVA** files start with
``pmm-server-`` followed by the full version number such as |release|.

To use this script, make sure to replace this placeholder with the the name of
the image that you have downloaded from the `Download Percona Monitoring and
Management`_ site. This script also assumes that you have changed the working
directory (using the ``cd`` command, for example) to the directory which contains
the downloaded image file.
