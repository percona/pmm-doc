===========================================
Percona Monitoring and Management 2.2.1
===========================================

:Date: January 23, 2020

`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html>`_ (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance.

For *PMM* install instructions, see :ref:`pmm.deploying.server` and :ref:`pmm.deploying.client`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.

PMM Server version 2.2.0 suffered an unauthenticated denial of service
vulnerability (CVE-2020-7920). Any other PMM versions do not carry the same code
logic, and are thus unaffected by this issue. **Users who have already deployed
PMM Server 2.2.0 are advised to upgrade to version 2.2.1 which resolves this
issue.**

Improvements and new features
=============================

* :pmmbug:`5229`: The new RDS Exporter section added to the Prometheus Exporter
  Status dashboard shows singlestats and charts related to the ``rds_exporter``
* :pmmbug:`5228` and :pmmbug:`5238`: The Prometheus dashboard and the Exporters
  Overview dashboard were updated to include the ``rds_exporter`` metrics in
  their charts, allowing better understanding of the impacts of monitoring RDS
  instances
* :pmmbug:`4830`: The consistency of the applied filters between the Query
  Analytics and the Overview dashboards was implemented, and now filters
  selected in QAN will continue to be active after the switch to any of the
  Overview dashboards available in the Services menu
* :pmmbug:`5235`: The DB uptime singlestats in node rows on the Home dashboard
  were changed to show minimal values instead of average ones to be consistent
  with the top row
* :pmmbug:`5127`: The "Search by" bar on the Query Analytics dashboard was
  renamed to "Filter by" to make its purpose more clear
* :pmmbug:`5131`: The Filter panel on the Query Analytics dashboard now shows
  the total number of available Labels within the "See all" link, which appears
  if the Filter panel section shows only top 5 of its Labels

Fixed bugs
==========

* :pmmbug:`5232`: The pmm-managed component of the PMM Server 2.2.0 is
  vulnerable to DoS attacks, that could be carried out by anyone who knows the
  PMM Server IP address (CVE-2020-7920). Versions other than 2.2.0 are not
  affected.
* :pmmbug:`5226`: The handlebars package was updated to version 4.5.3
  because of the Prototype Pollution vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-19919). 
  Please note PMM versions were not affected by this vulnerability, as
  handlebars package is used as a build dependency only.
* :pmmbug:`5206`: Switching to the Settings dashboard was breaking the visual
  style of some elements on the Home dashboard
* :pmmbug:`5139`: The breadcrumb panel, which shows all dashboards visited
  within one session starting from the root, was unable to fully show breadcrumb
  longer than one line
* :pmmbug:`5212`: The explanatory text was added to the Download PMM Server Logs
  button in the Diagnostic section of the PMM Settings dashboard, and a link to
  it was added to the Prometheus dashboard which was the previous place to
  download logs
* :pmmbug:`5215`: The unneeded ``mariadb-libs`` package was removed from the
  PMM Server 2.2.0 OVF image, resulting in both faster updating with the
  ``yum update`` command and avoiding dependency conflict messages in the update
  logs
* :pmmbug:`5216`: PMM Server Upgrade to 2.2.0 was showing Grafana Update Error
  page with the Refresh button which had to be clicked to start using the
  updated version
* :pmmbug:`5211`: The "Where do I get the security credentials for my Amazon
  RDS DB instance" link in the Add AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance dialog
  was not targeted at the appropriate instruction
* :pmmbug:`5217`: PMM2.x OVF Image memory size was increased from 1Gb to 4Gb
  with the additional 1Gb swap space because the previous amount was hardly
  housing the PMM Server, and it wasn't enough in some cases like performing an
  upgrade
* :pmmbug:`5271`: LVM logical volumes were wrongly resized on AWS deployment,
  resulting in "no space left on device" errors
* :pmmbug:`5295`: Innodb Transaction Rollback Rate values on the MySQL InnoDB
  Details dashboard were calculated incorrectly
* :pmmbug:`5270`: PXC/Galera Cluster Summary dashboard was showing empty Cluster
  drop-down list, making it impossible to choose the cluster name
* :pmmbug:`4769`: The wrongly named "Timeout value used for retransmitting"
  singlestat on the Network Details dashboard was renamed to "The algorithm used
  to determine the timeout value" and updated to show the algorithm name instead
  of a digital code
* :pmmbug:`5260`: Extensive resource consumption by pmm-agent took place in case
  of Query Analytics for PostgreSQL; it was fixed by a number of optimizations
  in the code, resulting in about 4 times smaller memory usage
* :pmmbug:`5261`: CPU usage charts on all dashboards which contain them have
  undergone colors update to make softIRQ and Steal curves better differentiated
* :pmmbug:`5244`: High memory consumption in the PMM Server with a large number
  of agents sending data simultaneously was fixed by improving bulk data
  insertion to the ClickHouse database
