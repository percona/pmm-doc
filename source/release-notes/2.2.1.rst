===========================================
Percona Monitoring and Management 2.2.1
===========================================

:Date: January XX, 2020

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

For *PMM* install instructions, see :ref:`pmm.deploying.server` and :ref:`pmm.deploying.client`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.

Improvements and new features
=============================

Fixed bugs
==========

* :pmmbug:`5215`: The unneeded ``mariadb-libs`` package was removed from the
  PMM Server 2.2.0 OVF image, resulting in both faster updating with the
  ``yum update`` command and avoiding dependency conflict messages in the update
  logs
* :pmmbug:`5216`: PMM Server Upgrade to 2.2.0 was showing Grafana Update Error
  page with the Refresh button which had to be clicked to start using the
  updated version
