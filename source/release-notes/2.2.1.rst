.. _2.2.0:

===========================================
Percona Monitoring and Management 2.2.1
===========================================

:Date: January XX, 2020

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

For *PMM* install instructions, see :ref:`pmm.deploying.server` and :ref:`pmm.deploying.client`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.

Improvements and new features
=============================

* :pmmbug:`5235`: The DB uptime singlestats in node rows on the Home dashboard
  were changed to show minimal values instead of average ones to be consistent
  with the top row

Fixed bugs
==========

* :pmmbug:`5206`: Switching to the Settings dashboard was breaking the visual
  style of some elements on the Home dashboard
* :pmmbug:`5139`: The breadcrumb panel, which shows all dashboards visited
  within one session starting from the root, was unable to fully show breadcrumb
  longer than one line
* :pmmbug:`5212`: The explanatory text was added to the Download PMM Server Logs
  button in the Diagnostic section of the PMM Settings dashboard, and a link to
  it was added to the Prometheus dashboard which was the previous place to
  download logs
* :pmmbug:`5215`: The unneeded ``mariadb-libs`` package was removed from the
  PMM Server 2.2.0 OVF image, resulting in both faster updating with the
  ``yum update`` command and avoiding dependency conflict messages in the update
  logs
* :pmmbug:`5216`: PMM Server Upgrade to 2.2.0 was showing Grafana Update Error
  page with the Refresh button which had to be clicked to start using the
  updated version
* :pmmbug:`5211`: The "Where do I get the security credentials for my Amazon
  RDS DB instance" link in the Add AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance dialog
  was not targeted at the appropriate instruction
