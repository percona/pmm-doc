===========================================

:Date: December 9, 2019

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/2.x/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

For install instructions, see :ref:`deploy-pmm`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.

Improvements and new features
=============================

* :pmmbug:`4976`: Home dashboard clean-up: "Systems under monitoring" and 
  "Network IO" singlestats were refined to be based on the ``host`` variable and
  to avoid using color as an indicator respectfully; "All" row elements were
  relinked to a "Nodes Overview" dashboard with regards to a selected host.
* :pmmbug:`4800`: The ``pmm-admin add mysql`` command have undergone help and
  messages improvements related to the table statistics collection
* :pmmbug:`4969`: Update Grafana to version 6.4.4
* :pmmbug:`5053`: A tooltip was added to the Head Block graph on the Prometheus
  dashboard

Fixed bugs
==========

* :pmmbug:`4978`: Change the Top MySQL Questions singlestat on the MySQL
  Instances Overview dashboard to show ops instead of percentage

* :pmmbug:`4917`: the "Systems under monitoring" and "Monitored DB Instances" 
  singlestats on the Home dashboard now have a sparkline to make situation more
  clear with recently shut down nodes/instances

* :pmmbug:`4979`: Set decimal precision ``2`` for all the elements, including
  charts and singlestats, on all dashboards

* :pmmbug:`4980`: Fix "Load Average" singlestat on the Node Summary dashboard to
  show decimal value instead of percent

* :pmmbug:`4981`: Disable automatic color gradient in filled graphs on all
  dashboards

* :pmmbug:`4941`: Some charts were incorrectly showing empty fragments with high
  time resolution turned on

* :pmmbug:`5022`: Fix outdated drill-down links on the Prometheus Exporters
  Overview and Nodes Overview dashboards
  
* :pmmbug:`5023`: Make the All instances uptime singlestat on the Home dashboard
  to show Min values instead of Avg

* :pmmbug:`5029`: Option to upload dashboard snapshot to Percona disappeared
  after upgrade

* :pmmbug:`4946`: rename singlestats on the Home dashboard for better clearance:
   "Systems under monitoring" to "Nodes under monitoring" and "Monitored DB
   Instances" to "Monitored DB Services", and make the last one to count remote
   DB instances also

* :pmmbug:`5015`: Fix format of Disk Page Buffers singlestat on the Compare
  dashboard for PostgreSQL to have two digits precision for the consistency with
  other singlestats

* :pmmbug:`5014`: LVM logical volumes were wrongly sized on a new AWS
  deployment, resulting in "no space left on device" errors.
