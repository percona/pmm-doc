Percona Monitoring and Management 2.3.0
===========================================

:Date: February 19, 2020

`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html>`_ (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance.

For *PMM* install instructions, see :ref:`pmm.deploying.server` and :ref:`pmm.deploying.client`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.

Improvements and new features
=============================

* :pmmbug:`5064` and :pmmbug:`5065`: Starting from this release, `users will be able to integrate PMM with an external Alertmanager <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/faq.html#how-to-integrate-alertmanager-with-pmm>`_ by specifying the
  Alertmanager URL and the Alert Rules to be executed inside the PMM server
  
  .. note:: This feature is for advanced users only at this point
  
* :pmmbug:`4954`: Query Analytics dashboard now shows units both in the list of
  queries in a summary table and in the Details section to ease understanding
  of the presented data
* :pmmbug:`5179`: Relations between metrics are now specified in the Query
  Analytics Details section
* :pmmbug:`5115`: The CPU frequency and temperature graphs were added to the
  CPU Utilization dashboard
* :pmmbug:`5394`: A special treatment for the node-related dashboards was
  implemented for the situations when the data resolution change causes new
  metrics to be generated for existing nodes and services, to make graphs show
  continuous lines of the same colors

Fixed bugs
==========

* :pmmbug:`4620`: The high CPU usage by the pmm-agent process related to MongoDB
  Query Analytics was fixed
* :pmmbug:`5377`:  Singlestats showing percentage had sparklines scaled
  vertically along with the graph swing, which made it difficult to visually
  notice the difference between neighboring singlestats.
* :pmmbug:`5204`: Changing resolution on the PMM settings page was breaking some
  singlestats on the Home and MySQL Overview dashboards
* :pmmbug:`5251`: Vertical scrollbars on the graph elements were not allowed to
  do a full scroll, making last rows of the legend unavailable for some graphs
* :pmmbug:`5410`: The "Available Downtime before SST Required" chart on the
  PXC/Galera Node Summary dashboard was not showing data because it was unable
  to use metrics available with different scraping intervals
