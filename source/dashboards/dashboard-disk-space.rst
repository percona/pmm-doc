****************
Mountpoint Usage
****************

This metric shows the percentage of disk space utilization for every mountpoint
defined on the system. It is not good having some of the mountpoints close to
100% of space utilization, the risk is to have a *disk full* error that can
block one of the services or even causing a crash of the entire sytem.

In case a mountpoint is close to 100%, consider to cancel unused files or to
expand the space allocate to it.
