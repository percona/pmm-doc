Supported versions of PostgreSQL
--------------------------------

PMM follows `postgresql.org EOL policy <https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/>`_, and thus supports monitoring PostgreSQL version 9.4 and up.  Older versions may work, but will not be supported.  For additional assistance, visit `Percona PMM Forums <https://www.percona.com/forums/questions-discussions/percona-monitoring-and-management/>`_.
