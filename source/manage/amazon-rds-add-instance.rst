--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding an Amazon RDS MySQL, Aurora MySQL, or Remote Instance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The |pmm-add-instance| is now a preferred method of adding an |amazon-rds|
database instance to |pmm|. This method supports |amazon-rds| database instances
that use |amazon-aurora|, |mysql|, or |mariadb| engines, as well as any remote PostgreSQL, ProxySQL, MySQL and MongoDB instances.

Following steps are needed to add an |amazon-rds| database instance to |pmm|:

1. Open the |pmm| web interface and select the |pmm-add-instance| dashboard.

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/pmm-add-instance.png

   Choosing the |pmm| *Add instance* menu entry

#. Select the |gui.add-rds-aurora-instance| option in the dashboard.
#. Enter the access key ID and the secret access key of your |iam| user.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.access-key-id:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.png

      Enter the access key ID and the secret access key of your |iam| user

#. Click the |gui.discover| button for |pmm| to retrieve the available |amazon-rds|
   instances.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.displaying:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.1.png

      |pmm| displays the available |amazon-rds| instances

   For the instance that you would like to monitor, select the
   |gui.start-monitoring| button.

#. You will see a new page with the number of fields. The list is divided into
   the following groups: *Main details*, *RDS database*, *Labels*, and
   *Additional options*. Some already known data, such as already entered
   *AWS access key*, are filled in automatically, and some fields are optional.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.rds-instances.main-details:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.rds-instances.1.png

      Configuring the selected |rds| or |amazon-aurora| instance: the
      *Main details* section

   The *Main details* section allows to specify the DNS hostname of your instance,
   service name to use within PMM, the port your service is listening on, the
   database user name and password.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.rds-instances.rds-database:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.rds-instances.2.png

      Configuring the selected |rds| or |amazon-aurora| instance: the
      *RDS database* section

   The *RDS database* section contains the AWS access and secret keys,
   and the Instance ID, which are already filled in.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.rds-instances.labels:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.rds-instances.3.png

      Configuring the selected |rds| or |amazon-aurora| instance: the
      *Labels* section

   The *Labels* section allows specifying labels for the environment, the AWS
   region and availability zone to be used, the Replication set and Cluster
   names and also it allows to set the list of custom labels in a key:value
   format.

   .. _figure.pmm.amazon-rds.pmm-server.add-instance.rds-instances.additional:

   .. figure:: ../.res/graphics/png/metrics-monitor.add-instance.rds-instances.4.png

      Configuring the selected |rds| or |amazon-aurora| instance: the
      *Additional options* section for the remote MySQL databse

   The *Additional options* section contains specific flags which allow to tune
   the RDS monitoring. They can allow you to skip connection check, to use TLS
   for the database connection, not to validate the TLS certificate and the
   hostname.

   Also this section contains a database-specific flag, which would allow Query
   Analytics for the selected remote database:

   * when adding some remote MySQL, AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance, you
     will be able to choose using performance schema for the database monitoring
   * when adding a PostgreSQL instance, you will be able to activate using
     ``pg_stat_statements`` extension
   * when adding a MongoDB instance, you will be able to choose using
     QAN MongoDB profiler

   # Finally press the |gui.add-service| button to start monitoring your instance.
