`Uninstalling monitoring services with pmm-admin uninstall <pmm-admin.uninstall>`_
==================================================================================

Use the |pmm-admin.uninstall| command to remove all services even if
|pmm-server| is not available.  To uninstall |pmm| correctly, you first need to
remove all services, then uninstall |pmm-client|, and then stop and remove
|pmm-server|.  However, if |pmm-server| is not available (disconnected or shut
down), |pmm-admin.rm|_ will not work.  In this case, you can use
|pmm-admin.uninstall| to force the removal of monitoring services enabled for
|pmm-client|.

.. note:: Information about services will remain in |pmm-server|, and it will
   not let you add those services again.  To remove information about orphaned
   services from |pmm-server|, once it is back up and available to |pmm-client|,
   use the |pmm-admin.repair|_ command.
