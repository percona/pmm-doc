Tools of PMM
############

You can access the PMM web interface using the IP address of the host where
PMM Server is running.  For example, if PMM Server is running on a host with
IP 192.168.100.1, access the following address with your web browser:
``http://192.168.100.1``.

The PMM home page that opens provides an overview of the environment that you
have set up to monitor by using the ``pmm-admin`` tool.

From the PMM home page, you can access specific monitoring tools, or
dashboards. Each dashboard features a collection of metrics. These are graphs of
a certain type that represent one specific aspect showing how metric values
change over time.

By default the PMM home page lists most recently used dashboards and helpful
links to the information that may be useful to understand PMM better.

The PMM home page lists all hosts that you have set up for monitoring as well
as the essential details about their performance such as CPU load, disk
performance, or network activity.
