Updating a Server
#################

Client and server components are installed and updated separately.

PMM Server can run natively, as a Docker image, a virtual appliance, or an AWS cloud instance. Each has its own installation and update steps.

The preferred and simplest way to update PMM Server is with the *PMM Upgrade* panel on the Home page.

The panel shows:

- the current server version and release date;
- whether the server is up to date;
- the last time a check was made for updates.

Click the refresh button to manually check for updates.

If one is available, click the update button to update to the version indicated.
