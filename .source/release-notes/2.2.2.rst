Percona Monitoring and Management 2.2.2
===========================================

:Date: February 4, 2020

`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html>`_ (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

For *PMM* install instructions, see :ref:`pmm.deploying.server` and :ref:`pmm.deploying.client`.

.. note:: PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation â€” your existing
   PMM 1 environment can't be upgraded to this version.


Improvements and new features
=============================

* :jirabug:`PMM-5321`: The optimization of the Query Analytics parser code for
  PostgreSQL queries allowed us to reduce the memory resources consumption by
  1-5%, and the parsing time of an individual query by 30-40%
* :jirabug:`PMM-5184`: The ``pmm-admin summary`` command have gained a new
  ``--skip-server`` flag which makes it operating in a local-only mode, creating
  summary file without contacting the PMM Server

Fixed bugs
==========

* :jirabug:`PMM-5340`: The Scraping Time Drift graph on the Prometheus dashboard
  was showing wrong values because the actual metrics resolution wasn't taken
  into account
* :jirabug:`PMM-5060`: Qery Analytics Dashboard did not show the row with the last
  query of the first page, if the number of queries to display was 11
