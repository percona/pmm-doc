*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/2.x/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

For install instructions, see :ref:`Installing Percona Monitoring and Management <pmm.deploying.server>`.
