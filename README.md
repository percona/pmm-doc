# Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) Documentation
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fpercona%2Fpmm-doc.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fpercona%2Fpmm-doc?ref=badge_shield)

[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) is a free, open-source, database monitoring solution.

This repo holds the source files for the PMM technical documentation published at <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/>.


To contribute to the documentation, you can:

- **report a general problem** -- open an [Issue in this repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm-doc/issues/new?title=PMM%20doc%20issue&body=Please%20describe%20the%20issue%20here) or use [Percona's Jira](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM).

- **report a problem on a page** -- on every page of our documentation is a link, *Report a problem with this page*, a shortcut to this repo's *Issues*. (The link pre-fills the issue's subject so we know what page you're on.) Click, explain, and we'll fix it.

- **fix a problem yourself** -- there is also an *Edit this page* link that will bring you to this repo to edit the Markdown source file for that page. Make your changes (you'll have to fork the repo unless you're Percona staff) and submit a PR which we'll review and adjust where necessary before merging and publishing. If the changes are more than a few lines, you might want to build the website locally to see how it looks in context. To do that, read on.

## Introduction

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to convert [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files into a static HTML website (or [PDF](#pdf)). This process is called [*building the documentation*](#building-the-documentation).

The documentation is in the `docs` directory. To know about other files in this repo, jump to [Directories and files](#directories-and-files).

We use different branches for PMM versions:

- `main` is for PMM 2 (latest)
- `1.x` is for PMM 1

Before you start, you'll need to know:

- what [git](https://git-scm.com), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are;
- what [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is and how to write it;
- how to install and run those things on the command line.

(If you don't, open an [Issue](https://github.com/percona/pmm-doc/issues/new?title=PMM%20doc%20issue&body=Please%20describe%20the%20issue%20here) instead.)

## Building the documentation

1. Clone this repository
2. Change directory to `pmm-doc`
3. Either:
	- [Use Docker](#use-docker)
	- [Install MkDocs and dependencies](#install-mkdocs-and-dependencies)

### Use Docker

1. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/perconalab/pmm-doc-md) to *build the documentation* (create a static web site in the `site` subdirectory):

		docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/docs perconalab/pmm-doc-md mkdocs build -t material

3. Find the `site` directory, open `index.html` in a browser to view the first page of documentation.

If you'd like to see how things look as you edit, MkDocs has a built-in server for live previewing. After (or instead of) building, run:

	docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/docs -p 8000:8000 perconalab/pmm-doc-md mkdocs serve -t material --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000

and point your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Install MkDocs and dependencies

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install MkDocs and required extensions:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Build the site with your choice of theme:

		mkdocs build -t material
		# mkdocs build -t readthedocs

4. Open `site/index.html`

Or run the built-in web server.

    mkdocs serve -t material
    # mkdocs serve -t readthedocs

And view the site at <http://localhost:8000>

## PDF

To generate a PDF version of the documentation:

with Docker:

	docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/docs perconalab/pmm-doc-md -e ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=1 mkdocs build -t material

without:

	ENABLE_PDF_EXPORT=1 mkdocs build -t material

You'll find the PDF in `site/_pdf`.

## Directories and files

- `mkdocs.yml`: Main MkDocs configuration file
- `docs`:
	- `*.md`: Markdown files
	- `_images/*`: Images
	- `css`: Styling
	- `js`: JavaScript files
- `_resources`:
	- `bin`
	    - `glossary.tsv`: Export from a spreadsheet of glossary entries.
    	- `make_glossary.pl`: Script to write Markdown page from `glossary.tsv`.
    	- `grafana-dashboards-descriptions.py`: Script to extract dashboard descriptions from <https://github.com/percona/grafana-dashboards/>.
		- `plantuml`: Wrapper script for running PlantUML.
	- `diagrams`:
		- `*.puml`: [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) diagrams (see comments inside each).
	- `templates`: Stylesheet for PDF output (used by [mkdocs-with-pdf](https://github.com/orzih/mkdocs-with-pdf) extension).
	- `theme`: MkDocs templates that produce HTML output for percona.com hosting.
- `variables.yml`: Values used throughout the Markdown, including the current PMM version/release number.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

## Version switching

We are trialing the use of [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) to build different versions.

With this, a GitHUb action workflow runs `mike` (which runs `mkdocs`). The HTML is committed and pushed to the `publish` branch. The whole branch is then copied (by us, naturally) to our web server.

## Image overlays

`docs/using/interface.md` uses an image of the home dashboard overlaid with numbered boxes to identify menu bars and control. This approach means the home dashboard image and it's numbered version always look the same. Here's how it's done.

- `PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL.jpg` is created by [pmm-screenshots-pw](https://github.com/PaulJacobs-percona/pmm-screenshots-pw). If snapped by hand, it should be 1280x1120 pixels, to match the overlay image.
- `PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Overlay.png` is exported from `_resources/diagrams/PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Overlay.drawio` using <https://app.diagrams.net/>.

	1. Go to <https://app.diagrams.net/>
	2. If it's your first time, select *Device* at the *Save diagrams to:* dialog
	2. Click *Open existing diagram*
	3. Navigate to `pmm-doc/_resources/diagrams` and select `PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Overlay.drawio`
	4. If the dashboard layout has changed, replace the *Guide* Layer with a new screenshot and adjust the elements on the *Overlay* layer as needed (To show layers, click View --> Layers). Untick the *Guide* Layer so it is not exported.
	5. Click File --> Export as --> PNG
	6. In the *Image settings* dialog, use these settings:
		- *Zoom*: 100%, Border Width: 0
		- *Selection Only:* OFF
		- *Size:* Page
		- *Transparent Background:* ON
		- *Shadow:* OFF
		- *Grid*: OFF
		- *Include a copy of my diagram:* OFF
	7. Click *Export*
	8. Click *Device*
	9. Navigate to `pmm-doc/docs/_resources/diagrams` and click `PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Overlay.png`
	10. Click *Save* and overwrite the current file

The overlay image is merged with a copy of the latest home dashboard using [`composite`](https://imagemagick.org/script/composite.php), one of the ImageMagick tools.

	composite _resources/diagrams/PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Overlay.png docs/_images/PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL.jpg docs/_images/PMM_Home_Dashboard_TALL_Numbered.png

## Spelling and grammar

The GitHub actions build job performs a basic spell and grammar check. You can do these yourself on the command line if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

	npm i markdown-spellcheck -g
    mdspell --report --en-us --ignore-acronyms --ignore-numbers docs/<path to file>.md

To check all files:

	mdspell --report --en-us --ignore-acronyms --ignore-numbers "docs/**/*.md"

Add any custom dictionary words to `.spelling`. If spell checking fails, the GitHub action will fail too, but after the MkDocs build. The `publish` branch will still have the latest build and can be used. Meanwhile, see what the spelling error is and either fix it or add the word to `.spelling`.

Grammar is checked using [`write-good`](https://github.com/btford/write-good).

	npm i write-good -g
	write-good docs/<path to file>.md

To check all files:

	write-good docs/**/*.md
